Min. | Max. participants::: - | 60 
Instructors::: Dr. Aidan Boyle; Prof. Dr. Adalbert F.X. Wilhelm 
Official Course Description:::  The Let The Data Speak USC aims to explore the application of statistical methods in analyzing music composition. By studying different styles of music as well as various aspects of music theory and the mathematical concepts involved, the course aims to provide the students with a foundation to apply statistical processes for musical analysis. Beginning with a history of the study, followed by an in depth analysis and theoretical foundation, and ending with an independent student project, the course offers theoretical basis leading to practical application. Group projects will involve developing a method for statistically analyzing a live stream of biometric data (e.g. movement of a participant in interactive installation or a dancer on stage) and creatively manipulating it using algorithms and filters to generate a contemporary sound composition. An approach to sonification of data will be used to gain insight into periodicities and patterns within the data itself. Given that sound offers a myriad of qualities, data may be mapped to any number of sound parameters, thus opening up new ways to understand data or information, and even reveal formerly hidden structures and meaning. 
Artists, practitioners and lecturers from relevant areas of the arts, statistics, and psychology sectors, will be invited to contribute to this course. In addition, analysis/demonstrations of recent interactive performances realized by the author and other artists will provide a hands-on opportunity to better understand the creative and technological processes.

Name::: 020088 Law and Ethics (TDC)
Min. | Max. participants::: - | 60 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Manfred Hinz 
Official Course Description:::  Legal scholars have difficulties to agree on a generally acceptable definition of law. There is, nevertheless, the common understanding that each society has law and that the function of such law is providing rules for the organisation of that society, including the behaviour of its members. 
 
Listening to ordinary voices, we hear that certain behaviour is called “unethical”, or “immoral”. This can happen when somebody acts in a specific way, which is seen to be in violation of ethical standards or moral obligations, or a person does not act at all although he / she was expected to act. For some, including scholars of philosophy, ethics and moral (and / or the morals) are used interchangeable. Others draw a distinction between ethics and moral. According to this, ethics is part of philosophy and as such the meta-level which reflects on norms, be them legal or non-legal. In this sense, the moral norms in a society, which are not necessarily included in the respective legal order, are subject of ethics. 
 
Ethics reflects normative perceptions. Ethical discourses collect and research the social foundation of moral perception. Ethics describes, questions, reasons, substantiates and develops normative perceptions, standards and rules. The various theories of ethics, theories reaching from Aristotle to Kant, from Rawls to modern proponents of hermeneutical ethics contribute to the vast field of ethics in their specific manner. Ethical reflections explore the viability of the ethical instruments submitted by ethical theory for the ethical solution of problems, including problems described as “ethical dilemmas”. However, the bigger part of the ethical discourse focuses on approaches to ethics in the philosophy of the western world and, with this, addresses the Western move to the secular state and the subsequent emphasis on (secular) ethics. Questions about ethics and the relationship of ethics and law in other frames of thoughts, e.g. the Islamic, the African or the Chinese frame of thought, in particular, require attention when problems arising from cultural diversities have to be dealt with.

Min. | Max. participants::: - | 50 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Thomas Heine; Prof. Dr. Klaus Schömann 
Official Course Description:::  Surely new technology is constantly shaping societies, but how about the reverse causality of how societies shape, facilitate or impede modern technologies? The relationship between the two concepts “society” and “technology” is subject to continuous adaptation. We shall explore the relationship based our expertise and on the scientific literature on knowledge creation and innovation processes. Based on the concept of “creative destruction” coined by Schumpeter as a driver of economic and social change we investigate throughout the course the distinction between incremental development versus radical innovation. Examples of innovation processes range from energy, transport, architecture, military, fashion, press and social media to biological innovation. 
Having introduced the basic concepts for analyses of such innovation processes students will carry out own projects or case studies of specific technological or societal innovations. Within these projects, the social and economic process of what leads to the innovation as well as the likely or already observed impact of the innovation will be investigated. Students can choose an innovation process of their choice in agreement with the course instructors and prepare a presentation and written documentation of this process. In addition each student will present a “technology assessment” based on a real product inspection in combination with a visit to the CEBIT and/or HannoverMesse 2014 as a professional environment.

Official Course Description:::  What is health? Who is healthy? Which behaviors are health related in which people? How can we support individuals adopting and maintaining healthy lifestyles? 
In western industrialized nations, an increasing amount of people reach old and very old age whilst birth rates decline. This trend coincides in an increasing need to promote a healthy lifestyle and in turn to promote successful and productive aging. 
The USC will provide you with multiple facets of health ranging from different health models and health behaviour models to different lifestyle factors that promote health across the lifespan. Further you will get hands on tools to assess health and successfully improve health behavior. We will investigate different options on campus which might be health (behaviour) related i.e. might improve or impede health (behaviour) or might be an environment to study health related topics. Students are expected to work on small group projects which will be presented in the end of this course in form of posters.

Official Course Description:::  The International Logistics Program’s Research Colloquium above all provides a forum for students of the program to present and discuss their current research, in particular their master theses. 
Its purpose is to familiarize students with concrete problems from the actual practice of international logistics. All professors who teach in the program as well as all graduate students of International Logistics may participate in the colloquium. It aims to strengthen the students’ understanding of logistics related issues and make them more aware of the problems encountered when applying theories and methods to concrete research topics. The colloquium offers students the opportunity to present their work to a wide audience, allowing them to get advice from fellow students and other participants involved. Thus the colloquium, in addition to individual tutoring by thesis supervisors, is an important part of the tutoring process. 
Other contributions to the Research Colloquium may consist of lectures by Jacobs University professors or guest speakers. Students will learn to critically discuss and assess the advantages and problems of logistics-related methods and issues as well as the results of concrete research in the field.

Official Course Description:::  This lab is on the one hand intended to directly accompany the corresponding DSP lecture in performing C and Matlab realizations of, e.g., transforms and digital filters. On the other hand it tries to give an insight into a system realization on a signal processor and FPGA platform. For signal-processor implementations, first tools are used to generate the DSP code followed by optimization of time-critical code segments. This means, learning DSP assembler programming will be part of the course. In the case of FPGA, tools will also generate the VHDL code, but essential VDHL properties will be taught, as well. Some of the experiments will be devoted to the communications field. The lab will thus as well serve as a counterpart for the communications lecture.

Official Course Description:::  The course continues the introduction of the fundamental concepts and techniques of Computer Science. Building on Boolean Algebra, it 
 introduces Propositional Logic as a model for general logical systems (syntax, semantics, calculi). Based on elementary graph theory, combinatory circuits are introduced as basic logic computational devices. Interpreting sequences of Boolean values as representations of numbers (in positional number systems, twos-complement system), Boolean circuits are extended to numerical computational machines (presenting adders, subtracters, multipliers) and extended to basic ALUs. The course introduces very elementary computer architectures and assembly language concrete computational devices, and compares them to Turing machines to fathom the reach of computability. 
 
In a final part of the course, two topics of general Computer Science are covered in depth, for instance ``search algorithms'' and ``programming as search'' to complement the rather horizontal (i.e. methods-oriented) organization of the course with vertically (i.e. goal-oriented) organized topics. 
 
Topics 
Propositional logic, calculi, soundness, completeness, automated theorem proving, combinatory circuits, assembler turing machines, search, logic programming.

 Further Grading Information:
 Grading and exams: The final course grade will be composed from homeworks (10%), presence sheets (10%), active participation in class (5%), and quizzes/exams. There will be four miniquizzes (written in class, 20 minutes), the best three of which will each account to 15% of the final grade (worst will be dropped from calculating the grade), and one final exam, counting 30%. All quizzes are open book. Each quiz or exam yields a maximum of 100 points. The total semester points Pts_total are computed as the weighted semester point average (each quiz points are weighted by 0.15, the final by 0.30, etc.), and from Pts_total the final grade is computed by the standard Jacobs formula. 
 
Miniquiz makeup rules: if a miniquiz is missed without excuse, it will be graded with 0 points. An oral makeup will be offered for medically excused miniquizzes according to the Jacobs rules (especially, the medical excuse must be announced to me on the day of the miniquiz). Non-medical excuses can be accepted and miniquiz makeups be arranged on a case-by-case basis.

Official Course Description:::  This lecture presents one half of the core material of theoretical computer science (the other half is covered in the lecture ``Formal Languages and Logic''). The question: ``What problems can a computer possibly solve?'', is fully answered (by characterizing those solvable problems, equivalently, through Turing machines, random access machines, recursive functions and lambda calculus). A full answer to the related question, ``how much computational resources are needed for solving a given problem'' is not known today. However, the basic outlines of today's theory of computational 
 complexity will be presented up to the most famous open problem in computer science, namely the famous ``P = NP'' question: if a computer can guess the answer to a problem (and only needs to check its correctness), does that really help to speed up computation? 
 
Topics: 
Computable functions and complexity, lambda calculus, functional programming.

Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Peter Baumann 
Official Course Description:::  Course contents : The title of this course can, and should, be understood in a twofold way. On 
the conceptual level, mastering the rapidly growing volume and complexity of information in 
industry, science, and society requires improved modelling and design methodologies. On the 
implementation level, existing storage, retrieval, and delivery techniques have to be revisited 
and new ones have to be designed in order to meet the challenges formulated conceptually. 
While these issues largely fall into the fields of databases, information retrieval, and Internet 
technology, the questions arising clearly transcend these fields and call for interdisciplinary 
research on more efficient and effective methods. 
The course, therefore, starts with an overview of existing knowledge in the core fields and then 
covers selected themes in more depth. Among the candidate themes are non-standard applications 
such as spatio-temporal databases and sensor networks, distributed databases, XML 
databases, multimedia databases, streams, raster databases, storage structures, and query optimization. 
Goal is to make students familiar with the state of the art in Web-enabled information systems 
so that they will be successful database/Internet professionals in IT industry and also have a 
sound knowledge base to specialize towards a scientific career in the field.

Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Michael Kohlhase 
Official Course Description:::  In this course we will cover the logical and linguistic foundation of syntactical 
and semantic modeling of natural language in computational linguistics (the study of natural 
languages from a computational perspective). We will proceed by the “method of fragments”, 
where fragments of natural language are studied on a syntactic level (grammar and lexicon), 
the semantic level (transforming syntactic structures into logical forms), and a pragmatic level 
(inferring material that is not explicitly realized linguistically). 
We will build up a sequence of fragments of increasing coverage (covering selected salient 
features of language) and discuss the linguistic and logical phenomena involved in detail. 
The course will be accompanied by a hands-on programming lab, where the topics of the course 
will be implemented in the programming language PROLOG.

spatial interpretation such as computer-generated data from numerical simulations (physics, 
chemistry) or measured data using scanning or sensor techniques (medicine, life sciences, geosciences). 
Volume visualization methods such as segmentation, surface extraction, and direct 
volume rendering for structured and unstructured gridded as well as scattered data are being 
taught. These include techniques for scalar field, vector field, and tensor field visualization. 
Information visualization deals with the visualization of abstract data with no spatial interpretation 
such as graph- or network-based data (life sciences, social sciences, computer networks) or 
multi-dimensional data (economics, databases). Methods that tackle these visualization problems 
are being taught. 
The course deepens, broadens, and enhances the knowledge in visualization obtained from the 
undergraduate course on "Graphics and Visualization" in terms of visualization methods.

Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Benjamin Godde 
Official Course Description:::  In the area of Neurobiology and Cognitive Psychology, respectively, a vast array of research methods exist for investigating neuropsychological processes from single cells to complex human behavior. In recent years, fundamentally new techniques have been introduced which enable researchers to gain new insights into processes (e.g. structural and functional neuroimaging, magnetoencephalography), or to specifically manipulate them (e.g. optogenetical methods), respectively. Apart from basic research, these new techniques and the well-established other methods (e.g. EEG, various behavioral and cognitive psychological tests) are very important in clinical investigations. In this respect, the understanding of neurodegenerative processes is of particular importance since early signs may be discovered well before first clinical signs of the disease occur, thus leading to better diagnosis and treatment options. The course provides an overview of the different methods used in the area of neurobiology and cognitive psychology.

Official Course Description:::  This lab course intends to intensely train students in laboratory practice on a given research project of the Instructor's group. It is an integrated part of the lab rotations each student has to attend during the 3rd year education. Two lab rotations per each semester of the 3rd year will give the students the opportunity to visit four different research laboratories of the various life sciences disciplines participating in this course structure. All individual lab rotations will finally be written up in a thesis to prove the student's ability of performing independent research. Scheduling has to be decided between the students and the individual Instructors of the particular lab rotations. The Instructors of Record of the BCCB, Bio / NSc, BICB, and BCE 3rd year lab courses I and II will have to organize for accommodation of each student within the research laboratories preferably of their first choices. However, this needs to be done in a way to allow equal and appropriate distribution of all students between the various research groups. Students will indicate their preferences, and the Instructors of Record will decide on the order of lab rotations during the 3rd year. To enable the students with the necessary information on which lab to choose, an information evening 
will be organized at the end of the 4th semester. Students are urged to attend.

Official Course Description:::  The course intends to give a detailed understanding on the biology of pro- and eukaryotic cells on the basis of the biochemistry of the structure and function of cellular macromolecules (see Advanced Biochemistry). Cells are limited by a plasma membrane bearing important functions like communication of cells with their surroundings. Within eukaryotic cells, biological membranes form cellular compartments to optimize biochemical reactions necessary for all cells to perform their biological functions. The biogenesis of cellular compartments will be a central part on the way of understanding the evolution of multicellular organisms. The complexitiy of cellular systems and of their macromolecular constituents becomes most obvious in certain disorders that have been characterized on the molecular level. Therefore, biomedical implications will be included where ever possible.

Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Matthias Ullrich 
Official Course Description:::  This course is designed to build up on the content of the General 
Biology I/II courses and to deepen the knowledge of physiological 
phenomena at the molecular level. Besides a detailed view into 
general microbiology and microbial ecology, the course deals with 
molecular aspects of evolution, microbiology, and plant cell biology 
and physiology. Therefore, special emphasis will be given to 
environmental, microbial, and "green" biology. This includes 
exciting insights into molecular aspects of the interactions between 
living organisms, such as symbiosis, infectious diseases, and global 
element cycles. While three units within the fall semester will 
cover the fields of Molecular Evolution, General Microbiology (incl. 
bacteria, protists, and fungi), and Microbial Ecology (incl. element 
cycles, symbiosis, and pathology), the three units of the spring 
semester will bring insights into Molecular Biology of Plant Cells, 
Plant Eco-physiology, and Plant and Microbial Genetics. 
Additionally, all units will highlight how we can explore our 
knowledge of microbial and plant molecular biology at the level of 
biotechnology.

Official Course Description:::  This lab course will train students in laboratory practice on a given research project of the Instructor's group. It is an integrated part of the lab rotations each student has to attend during the 3rd year of education. One lab rotation in each semester of the 3rd year will give the students the opportunity to work in a research laboratory of one of the various life sciences disciplines participating (see list of instructors). Both lab rotations will be written up in a thesis to prove the student's ability of performing guided research. Scheduling has to be decided between the students and the individual instructors of the particular lab rotations. The Instructor of Record will have to organize accommodation of the students within the research laboratories preferably of their first choices. However, this needs to be done in a way allowing equal and appropriate distribution of all students between the various research groups. To provide information about the research topics and how the course will be conducted, a meeting with the instructors will be organized at the end of the 4th semester. It is strongly recommended that all prospective 3rd year BCCB-students attend this information session.

Official Course Description:::  This course aims to introduce students to various aspects of biomedical research. Understanding the underlying molecular principles and mechanisms that enable our cells, tissues, and bodies to function properly will be of central interest. However, the complexity of biological systems becomes most obvious in challenging situations. Therefore, biomedical research has largely focused on chronic degenerative diseases of the adult such as atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer to name a few. In this course, we will discuss model organisms to which molecular medicine refers, experimental approaches taken to challenge cellular or organism functions, and we will talk about animal models for human diseases. In addition, we will discuss ethical considerations and results of clinical trials aiming at targeted therapy of a variety of disorders including osteoporosis and Alzheimer’s disease. The course content is updated every year to follow recent developments in molecular medicine.

Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Marc-Thorsten Hütt 
Official Course Description:::  Systems Biology aims at understanding the functioning of a cell due to the 
concerted action of its constituents. At the same time, however, many spatial and temporal 
scales contribute to cellular organization and turn it into a complex interplay of regulatory 
processes. It seems, therefore, futile addressing this problem of system understanding without 
the appropriate toolbox. This course provides the toolbox for ”doing Systems Biology”. 
In the first part we will look at general principles of systems modeling. We will discuss 
elementary models of dynamic processes, which help understand large classes of biological 
systems and then see, how an increase in complexity changes properties of the model. 
The second part covers system biologic models of specific cellular processes: metabolism, 
signal transduction and gene regulation. 
In the last segment we will discuss the integration of theoretical approaches: How can 
data sets on different levels of a biological systems been related and put into a wider context? 
How can specific models be interlinked, in order to pass from a minimal model (the domain of 
theoretical biology) to a realistic “in-silico” description (the realm of systems biology)? 
We also look at the current computational infrastructure of systems biology: data bases for 
mathematical models, standards for data formats. Beyond ACM, this course may also be of 
interest to biochemistry and computer science majors.

Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Hector Marcelo Fernandez Lahore 
Official Course Description:::  Biotechnology heavily depends on process engineering in order to deliver real products (or services) to the market and in order to generate a positive impact on modern societies. A biotechnologist has to master current industrial bioprocessing practise, from the microbial or cell producer (bioreaction) to the highly purified, formulated product. He/she must be able to design and optimize new processes, calculate for biological reactors, and develop efficient recovery and purification procedures (downstream processing). In this course students will learn how to design a bioprocessing "train". Important aspects are: Operating considerations for microbial fermentations, cell bioreactors for suspension and immobilized cultures, Selection, scale-up, and operation of bioreactors and enzyme reactors, Primary recovery and purification of products, Bioprocess considerations in using animal cell cultures, plant cell cultures, and genetically engineered organisms, among others. Practical demonstrations may take place during the course. Students will utilize a software package for process design and cost evaluation. New trends in bioprocess technology will be analyzed by focusing on innovative case studies.

Official Course Description:::  Cellular Biochemistry is an elective course for MoLife that is also accessible to third-year undergraduate students. It has fourteen sessions. 
The course builds on the understanding of biological systems established in the undergraduate courses, Advanced Cell Biology I+II and Advanced Biochemistry and Molecular Biology I+II, or equivalent. Although a brief introduction will be given, graduate or undergraduate students who have no foundation in cell biology should consider attending Advanced Cell Biology prior to this course. 
This is an intensive course, based on advanced textbooks, scholarly reviews, and recent research articles, that will take students to the cutting edge of a few select fields. The topics are a selection of complex and integrated systems from all areas of biochemistry and cell biology that change from year to year, and that are typically analyzed on all levels from their molecular mechanism to their cellular manifestations. They may include intracellular trafficking of proteins and lipids, synthesis and turnover of cellular components, regulation and signal transduction, and development and cooperation of cells in tissues. 
The course will also provide and train skills that are needed to understand and critique published data. 
Each subject is typically covered by: 
- a lecture-style initial introductory overview by the instructor; 
- a thorough discussion of selected topics that requires prior reading of review articles; 
- student presentations of research papers including a detailed analysis. 
Prior reading of the provided literature is essential, required, and relevant for the grade.

Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Matthias Ullrich 
Official Course Description:::  Infectious diseases have always been and still are a major thread to our civilization. Knowledge of the molecular basis and mode of action of many pathogen-mediated diseases has sky-rocketed in the past decades. This half-semester course is meant to familiarize the student with a selection of infectious diseases, the microbial pathogens causing them, and potential ways to heal infected persons. Although this selection of diseases can by no way be comprehensive due to time constraints, some of the most important diseases will be dealt with. For advanced participants (i.e. those who previously took the 3rd-year undergraduate Biomed and Infection Biology course) particular problem tasks for some diseases will be given. Diseases and pathogens to be dealt with include: HIV, TB, candidiosis, Salmonella, toxoplasmosis, malaria, bacterial toxins, plant pathogens, and sexually transmitted diseases. A total of 13 lectures will be followed by a final examination in the 14th time slot. Additionally, a short mid term quiz will be held.

Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Michael Hülsmann 
Official Course Description:::  The course General Logistics II is dedicated to the managerial side of logistics with a further focus on an entrepreneurial perspective. It addresses different corporate areas and management aspects, like marketing, strategizing, financial resources, coping with costs, creating value, going global, etc. in the context of logistics systems. In this context the course also has to pay respect to the various perspectives of different stakeholders of a Logistics Service Provider (LSP): customers, competitors, investors. 
Thereby, the consideration of corporate areas and single stakeholders shall serve as the basis for the development of business plans for LSP as a main focus of the course. Throughout the course the students have to create a business idea in the fields of logistics and to conceptualize a business plan for their idea step-by-step within small groups. 
For a successful generation of business ideas, a comprehensive theoretical background (e.g. business idea generation, business plan contents, etc.) will be conveyed through the lectures. Moreover, the business plan development will be supported by guest lectures (held by practitioners from different corporate functions – e.g. marketing, finance, etc). In addition, weekly arranged tutorials will gain the possibility to discuss lecture content, work on business ideas, and prepare presentations together with experienced tutors.

And finally the main steps of a structured planning process are derived. Practical examples from modern factories, a factory visit and group exercises along the planning phases will illustrate the topic. 
At the end of the course you will know: 
• why changeability is the key feature of modern factories, 
• why you should always start deriving the strategic base for a factory, 
• how the logistic profile for the buy, make and deliver process determines the structure of a factory, 
• how you plan a factory in clear defined steps with involvement of the users and 
• that a good appearance of a factory improves the corporate of a company image and the attractiveness for the employees.

Instructors::: Dr. Jan-Dirk Gehrke; Dr. Arne Schuldt 
Official Course Description:::  Information and communication technology (ICT) plays an increasingly important role for logistics planning and control. This course introduces the information systems that support human dispatchers in their duties. An important foundation is the synchronisation of real-world material flows with their corresponding information flows by means of identification systems. Furthermore, logistics processes are highly distributed among departments (e.g. procurement, production, distribution) and even companies. Therefore, communication technology as a foundation for implementing distributed information systems is another topic. 
 
The objective of this course is to enable logisticians to communicate with IT professionals in designing information systems for logistics. To this end, a focus lies on modelling information systems with respect to processes, data, information, and knowledge. Furthermore, future developments in ICT that do not only incorporate information systems but also automated control are discussed. Finally, simulation is considered as a means to validate control systems and logistics strategies.

Name::: 051472 Port Management and Operations
Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: M.Sc. Ilknur Erdogan; Prof. Dr. Jens Froese; Andreas Mai 
Official Course Description:::  Port is a complex industry and plays a great role in the logistics chain. Port is often seen only as a terminal where containers and other cargo units are loaded and discharged. In fact, the roles of the port are very diverse and vary from how the port is organised. 
Due to this complexity, it is very important to understand how the port according to different port models functions. Development plan of the port highly influences on the processes and services provided. 
In this course, the fundamentals of port operations will be introduced. Exercises and workshops in a group working on a concrete case study enhance the understanding of the complexity in this industry. 
 
Aims of course 
- To apply methodologies to model a complex industrial cluster with the aim to identify key services and processes and to improve those 
- To introduce essential elements of ports covering their administration, management and operations 
- To introduce different port model 
- To explain role of port authorities

Instructors::: Dr. Stefan Maubach 
Official Course Description:::  This course continues Analysis I and complements Analysis II. It continues 
with the classification of matrices and introduces elements of tensor algebra. 
In the first part, we continue the discussion of endomorphisms, discussing the Cayley- 
Hamilton Theorem and minimal polynomials, and giving some versions of Jordan normal form 
over non-algebraically closed fields. 
The second part of the course deals with dual spaces and quadratic, symmetric and skewsymmetric 
forms. We introduce the dual vector space and dual linear maps and their relation 
with bilinear forms. Classifications are given of symmetric and skew-symmetric real bilinear 
forms and of Hermitian and skew-Hermitian forms over the complex numbers. 
The last part is concerned with tensors — objects that play an important role in many 
branches of physics and mathematics. The tensor product of two (or more) vector spaces is 
introduced and properties are discussed including the universal property, contraction of tensors, 
‘outer’ and ‘inner’ products, and the relationship between linear maps and tensors.

Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: Dr. Keivan Mallahi-Karai 
Official Course Description:::  This course is an introduction to the language and some of the fundamental 
concepts of modern geometry. Manifolds are among the most fundamental concepts of mathematics: 
curves and surfaces are important special cases that have historical significance. 
The course starts with introducing the notion of a manifold, followed by examples that naturally 
arise in various areas of mathematics. Differentiability, tangent spaces and vector fields 
are then defined. This will be followed by establishing the notion of integration on manifolds. 
We will then formulate and prove Stokes’ theorem, which is the higher-dimensional generalization 
of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Among the further topics that are discussed in 
the course are: orientation, degree of a map, Lie groups and their actions. The classification 
of one- and two-dimensional manifolds and the Poincar´e-Hopf theorem will be some of the 
highlights of the course.

Name::: 100383 Applied Stochastic Processes
Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: Dr. Keivan Mallahi-Karai 
Official Course Description:::  This course aims at an introduction to the mathematical theory of financial 
markets that discusses important theoretical concepts from the theory of stochastic processes 
developed in parallel to their application to the mathematical finance. 
The applied part of this course revolves around the central question of option pricing in 
markets without arbitrage which will be first posed and fully solved in the case of binomial 
model. Interestingly enough, many of the fundamental concepts of financial mathematics such 
as arbitrage, martingale measure, replication and hedging will manifest themselves, even in 
this simple model. After discussing conditional expectation and martingales, more sophisticated 
models will be introduced that involve multiple assets and several trading dates. After 
discussing the fundamental theorem of asset pricing in the discrete case, the course will turn to 
continuous processes. The Wiener process, It¯o integrals, basic stochastic calculus, combined 
with the main applied counterpart, the Black-Scholes model, will conclude the course. 
This course alternates with Stochastic Processes.

The software is ideal for numerical work such as solving differential equations or analyzing large amounts of laboratory data. The computer will be used as a tool in this course so that you will also learn some mathematics alongside learning to use the computer program. This Lab Unit is particularly suited students from both schools interested in experiments, as Matlab is used as a standard tool for analyzing and visualizing data by scientists in many fields of research.

Hours per week::: 3 
Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: Dr. Keivan Mallahi-Karai 
Official Course Description:::  This course offers an introduction to ordinary differential equations and 
their applications. Mathematical modeling of continuous-time dynamics has its origins in classical 
mechanics but is now prevalent in all areas of physical and life sciences. Attempting to 
solve such problems often leads to a differential equation. Consequently, a variety of analytical 
and numerical methods have been developed to deal with various classes of equations and initial 
value problems, the most important of which is the class of linear equations. Other methods 
(such as Laplace transform) for solving many differential equations of special form will also 
be discussed. The course underlines the importance of qualitative analysis of differential equations, 
with a discussion of simple models such as the Lotka-Volterra equation. 
All students in the School of Engineering and Science with and interest in the application 
of Mathematics to real-life problems, and have a mathematical background equivalent to either 
Engineering and Science Mathematics 1B (Multivariable Calculus, ODE) or Analysis I/II 
should consider taking this course as a home school elective. Students of ACM can take this 
course as part of their second year major requirements.

Official Course Description:::  Biology module: 
Biology is around us; we ourselves are components of "biology". To appreciate our position in Nature, we need to know something about life itself, about different life forms, and the way living organisms interact with each other and with environmental features. The lectures are designed to provide the students with a taste of "Biodiversity" and the concept of "Ecosystems". Towards that end some specific habitats may be explained in some detail: the open sea, the cave habitat, and "the polar realm". 
Ecology module: 
This module is an introduction to ecological thought and principles and is concerned with the main aspects influencing the distribution and abundance of organisms. We will examine the main physical factors of the environment that influence organisms and the way in which organisms are adapted to those factors. The major types of ecosystems, the biomes, will be briefly surveyed. The module covers topics in the areas of individual organisms, population, community, and ecosystem ecology. The dynamics of energy flow and chemical cycling in ecosystems is also treated and some of the consequences of human intrusions into these processes are considered. 
Environmental Geoscience module: 
It will be demonstrated how physical, chemical and biological processes interact in the geological environment and drive the functions of the ecosystem. Anthropogenic changes in the ecosystem at local and global scales will be discussed, with emphasis on the degradation of the atmosphere, soil, water and geological and biological resources caused by human activity. Strategies are proposed for reversing environmental degradation and maintaining a healthful and sustainable earth. 
Environmental policy and management part II: 
This part will follow up the first series in GES I but will step into more detail and more analysis of problems and policies. It will introduce two legs of environmental studies. First, how to deal with scarce resources in a sustainable way? What is sustainable in the first place? Second, how to deal with "external effects" (i.e. actions of economic agents that do affect others, but that are no priced)? Thirdly, we will illustrate in some depth these two pillars with specific current policies, like Emission Trading Scheme or renewable energy policies.

Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Michael Bau; Prof. Dr. Andrea Koschinsky-Fritsche 
Official Course Description:::  Majors in IES are supposed to work on small research projects called Guided Research Projects (GRPs) in their third year of study. This work is formally organized in the framework of Guided research Courses (GRCs). A GRP may focus on experimental work, a field campaign, data analysis, computer simultations, theory, modeling, or a literature review. In order to be as effective as possible within the limited amount of time, we recommend to select one topic for both, the Fall and the Spring semester GRC. 
The Fall semester GRC may involve a literature review in order to prepare for a project in Spring when a lab, field, data analysis, modelling, or theory project should be carried out. Students are invited to contact intructors of their chosen specialization area for more information on potential project topics in the very beginning of the Fall semester. Each GRC must be concluded with a written report which will be graded.

Name::: 041211 Impact of Climate Change on Amazonian Ecosystems
Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: N.N. 
Official Course Description:::  The Amazon basin covers an area of approximately 6 Mio. km² and houses the largest and most diverse tropical forest on earth. The Amazon forest importantly contributes to the global biogeochemical and carbon cycles and regulates the regional and continental climate. There is growing evidence that the biota of Amazonian ecosystems is increasingly affected by climate change. Increased frequency of extreme drought and flood events particularly during the last decade puts the conservation of the Amazon forest in the forefront of public attention. However, deforestation by humans still endangers large parts of forests and locally reinforces natural climate trends. In addition, predictions of impacts of climate change on a basin-wide scale mostly fail because of the huge dimensions of the Amazon and the variability of its range of different ecosystems. 
The course gives an introduction to the biogeography and evolutionary history of the different Amazonian ecosystems with special emphasis on Amazonian wetlands, which cover approximately 30% of the area of the biodiversity. Hydrological trends of the major Amazonian rivers are presented in the context of climatological interactions, and their impact on the distribution, diversity, ecology and growth of the major vegetation types are demonstrated. Current and alternative management and conversation measures will be presented and discussed.

Name::: 200232 Reductionism in Physics and its Relation to Philosophy (TDC)
Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Hildegard Meyer-Ortmanns 
Official Course Description:::  The aim of the course is to discuss both the success and the limitations of methodological reductionism in physics. The assessment of the explanatory power of reductionism is a controversial issue, even between two Nobel prize winners from physics, Steven Weinberg and Phil Anderson. We shall first illustrate reductionism’s success in different areas of physics: relativity theory, gauge theories of the standard 
model, self-organized processes like pattern formation in cosmology, the renormalization group approach in condensed matter theory, and more generally topics of multi-scale modeling. The success becomes possible due to a few guiding principles, the exploitation of symmetries, but also due to large-scale computer simulations. Therefore one may be tempted to jump to conclusions and postulate the existence of a “world formula” or a “theory of everything”, such postulates are found in the literature until recently. Pointing out the 
limitations of reductionism in the second part of the course, it will become clear why such postulates are not meaningful. Limitations show up when the goal is to predict not only a single aspect, but the whole variety of emergent phenomena on a higher level of description when starting from a more fundamental one. We shall also review the very formulation of physical laws in stochastic and deterministic versions, the increasing complexity in the description that one has to face if 
the goal is to capture distinct aspects at the same time. Along with a comparison of stochastic and deterministic formulations, an important topic in the theory of evolution will be discussed. It is related to the role of contingency and necessity in time evolutions, in particular in the evolution of the universe. Here well-known representatives of opposing viewpoints are the paleontologists and biologists S. J. Gould and S. C. Morris. The reviews on topics from physics will be supplemented by some presentations from the philosophical side, discussing 
theories of explanation in physics and biology. From illustrations of the successful application of reductionism in different branches of physics, undergraduate students are expected to receive first reviews on achievements rather than a detailed understanding. A deeper understanding can be gained upon specialization on the graduate level. On the other hand, pointing out the limitations of reductionism opens the view for the need to include other disciplines than physics to approach complex systems in all their facets.

Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Ulrich Kleinekathöfer 
Official Course Description:::  Computational Physics discusses a number of practical, numerical solutions for typical problems in physics. While the very nature of physics is to express relationsships between physical quantities in mathematical terms, an analytic solution of the resulting formulars is often not available. Instead, numerical solutions based on computer programs are required to obtain useful results for real-life physics problems. During this course different numerical techniques are introduced such as integration, interpolation, root finding, function optimization, and solving differential equations which are important tools in any numerical approaches not only in physics. These approaches will be applied to a selection of problems incl. dynamics of few- and many-body systems, electrostatics, wave (packet) dynamics, random processes, etc. Since the course includes numerous examples and exercises for programming codes, some programming skills in Fortran or C are strongly recommended as prerequisites.

Official Course Description:::  Majors in Geosciences and Astrophysics are supposed to work on small research projects called Guided Research Projects (GRPs) in their third year of study at IUB. This work is formally organized in the framework of Guided Research Courses (GRCs). A GRP may focus on experimental work, a field campaign, data analysis, computer simultations, theory, modelling, or a literature review. In order to be as effective as possible within the very limited amount of time, we stronlgy recommend to select one topic for both, the Fall and the Spring semester GRC. 
The Fall semester GRC may involve a literature review in order to prepare for a project in Spring when a lab, field, data analysis, modelling, or theory project should be carried out. Students who are interested in taking a GRC in Geosciences and Astrophysics are invited to contact the instructors of record for more information on potential project topics. Each GRC must be concluded with a written report which will be graded.

Official Course Description:::  Marketing covers a set of diverse practices that connect firms to their relevant markets. This course introduces the principal marketing decision-making areas known as the four “Ps”: product, price, promotion and place. Actual decisions on these parameters depend on how firms communicate with, and learn from, their customers who may be private consumers (B2C) or other firms (B2B) buying goods as well as services. Students learn that marketing strategies are also shaped by how firms’ marketing is integrated with other business functions, by the behaviors of competitors and partner firms, and by the values, needs, and standards in the firms’ environment. Marketing plays a key role in firms’ internationalization strategies and, building on many practical examples, the course familiarizes students with issues around foreign market entry, globalization and localization of marketing policies, and coordination within multinationals.

Name::: 840202 Modern Economic History since the Industrial Revolution
Hours per week::: 3 
Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Welf Werner 
Official Course Description:::  The major economic transformation of the world that started in 18th-century England constitutes the core concern of this lecture. Since the field of modern economic history has witnessed a major transformation, with a significant expansion of both its subject area and its theoretical foundations, the classical process of the Industrial Revolution in technology and production will form an important starting point, but will not any more exclusively define this field. Attention will also be given to the preconditions of industrial growth in the agricultural and commercial economy of early-modern Europe. The history of economic processes has begun to include not just production, but also trade and consumption, as modern societies are increasingly defined as "consumer societies". In addition, the "cultural turn" has had its impact also on economic history, leading to a new emphasis on economic action, economic ideology, and the cultural implications of economic behavior. The lecture provides an overview over both classical and new topics in modern economic history, from early-modern beginnings to postwar economies after 1945 and issues of economic "globalization", and at the same time introduces students to different ways of conceptualizing past economies. The chief interest lies on Western economies, but their interrelations with local and dependent economies on the fringes of the Western world are also considered.

Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Rainer Tetzlaff 
Official Course Description:::  The seminar builds on the previous lecture on nineteenth century international relations. It provides an opportunity for a more detailed study of international relations in a broad sense, i.e. including politics and transnational activities. The analysis of major conflicts and developments from the First World War to the end of the Cold War provides students with a critical understanding of the making of today's world. Through the close reading of available documents and the engagement with scholarly debates, the structure of international relations, its institutions and underlying forces, as well as major events which shaped politicians' behavior gain life. The course focuses on issues like the origins of wars, peace-making, collective security, crisis management, economic dependency and cultural diplomacy. It highlights features particular to the twentieth century; the potential of mass destruction and its realization, the role of ideologies, the expansion of international organizations, economic relations and an increasing but uneven linkage between societies all over the world. The tension between fragmentation and globalization, which we still see today, is thus explained in historical terms.

Min. | Max. participants::: - | 30 
Instructors::: N.N. 
Official Course Description:::  After imperialism and colonialism, capitalism has transcended the system of the national states and cultures by generating a globalized economical and cultural world. The dynamics of globalization and migration creates multicultural and multilingual situations with specific tensions, problems and chances. Especially the national states with their monocultural and monolingual traditions face radically new social challenges which are discussed in theories of multiculturalism. Tensions arise between the old national languages (and the traditional regional languages), the languages of the immigrants and the new global language English: What language shall be used in public education, what shall be the position of the languages of the migrants in the public life of the states? What is the role of global English in these transformations? Is the spread of global English a case of linguistic imperialism, is it responsible for the death of languages, does it create a new aristocracy in the European countries? How does the European Union deal with the plurality of its languages? The course sheds light on these processes and tensions as mirrored in literature. It examines how multilingual authors have become a constitutive part of the literary scene, thus reshaping the concept and scope of literature, and in which way the regional and culturally homogenous mode of literary production is challenged by a global type of discourse and practice.

Min. | Max. participants::: - | -

Official Course Description:::  Learning Elements: 
 
? Introduction to basic ideas and concepts in Western and non-Western philosophy 
? Training in intercultural thinking 
? Training of rhetorical and presentation skills 
? Competence in scholarly writing 
 
Content: 
All cultures with systematic philosophical and religious traditions start from mythical thinking. They then tend to move on to consideration of permanent/timeless elements in knowledge and being, the explanation of change, and the determination of knowledge's scope and limits. These questions are explored not only in metaphysical and religious contexts, but also in theories of ethics, justice and politics, as well as in relation to beauty and the arts. 
In the western tradition, Platonic and Aristotelian philosophies have been of recurrent historical importance for all these questions. Indeed, they can act as foci for a more global survey course because they have been just as important for Islamic philosophy and theology (perhaps even more so), and have relevance also to key aspects of Hindu and Buddhist thought.

Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: Dr. Elke Wietoska 
Official Course Description:::  With the knowledge of what Logistics in general includes and after an introduction to law, both in the past terms, this course will deal with the legal aspects of transportation, for-warding and logistics. After an outline of several aspects of international and national trade law which includes the formation of contracts, incorporation of general conditions in general and the law of sales contracts, we will focus on national law of transportation, lo-gistics and freight forwarding. Thereafter the international conventions for the carriage of goods by sea, by air and by land including multimodal carriage will be subject of the course. Since logistics is a manifold area we will have to include several aspects like law of warehousing and the assembling of products. The handling of dangerous goods is sub-ject to a legal frame which also is shaped by international regulations and are dealt with in the lectures. 
 
At last, we will focus on the law of other contracts which are necessarily connected with the transport/logistics, e. g. insurance (marine and liability insurance), agency, construc-tion and long term contracts, product liability. 
 
Of course the student should be aware that the legal entities acting in the logistic busi-ness have different legal structures. Therefore, an outlook to the company law will be given. Professionals might get in contact with labour law, that is why an introduction should be given also to this. 
 
The course will end with an outline of the international private law (conflicts of law), juris-diction, litigation and arbitration.

This course deals with the question of how culture influences behavior in organizational settings, especially the effect of culture on management from a predominantly psychological perspective, and provides the essential concepts for global cross-cultural management. 
 
Starting from describing/comparing national cultures, and defining organizational culture, the intermediate mechanisms for the influence of culture on organizational behavior are explored using psychological concepts. Organization relevant factors such as organizational structure, workgroup/team, motivation, etc. will be illuminated in a cultural context. Based on the analysis of cultural environment and embedment, cross-cultural managerial activities will be elaborated in the process and behavior of decision making, leadership, communication, and negotiation across cultures. Further implications for international management, inter alia, for Human Resource Management are to be discussed as well.

Sensation refers to the process of detecting a stimulus or a stimulus property in the environment. It is the necessary collection of information about the world from which perceptions will be made. Perception refers to the way in which we interpret the information that is gathered by the senses. The process of perception can not be understood while ignoring the known physiology of the sensory systems that underlies the perceptual process. The course covers both physiological explanations for phenomena of perception and more cognitive aspects of the perceptional process, for which a physiological explanation might be available in the future. 
This lecture covers the following topics: 
 
- Methods of investigation: Phenomenological method; psychophysical methods such as methods of limits, method of constant stimuli, magnitude estimation, and basic ideas of signal detection; psychophysical measures such as absolute threshold, difference threshold, adaptation; Fechner's law, Weber's law, Stevens' power law. 
- Visual perception: The visual stimulus, the structure of the eye, neural processing including basic neural circuitry, and information flow and organization in the brain; perception of objects and models of object perception such as the Gestalt approach, feature integration theory (Treisman), recognition-by-component model (Biederman), Marr's computational approach; perception of depth, monocular depth cues, binocular depth cues; perception of color and models of color perception such as trichromatic theory, opponent-process theory; perception of movement, motion sensing systems such as image-retina system, eye-head system, corollary discharge theory; perceptual constancies such as color constancy, size constancy, lightness constancy, shape constancy; and phenomenon such as visual illusions. 
- Auditory perception: The sound stimulus, the structure of the ear, neural processing in the cochlea and auditory nerve; the experience of sound (loudness, pitch, timbre); perception of simple tones and complex sound; models such as Bekesy's Place Theory; localization of sound. 
- Touch and pain: The cutaneous stimulus; the skin and its different receptor systems; active versus passive touch; pain and pain relief, such as analgesia and endogenous opiates, placebo. 
- Smell and taste: The olfactory stimulus, the olfactory system, the taste stimulus, the taste system; pheromones; taste quality; flavor.

Hours per week::: 3 
Min. | Max. participants::: - | 30 
Instructors::: Dr. Dennis Küster 
Official Course Description:::  Emotion and motivation are central to our own experience of the world and strongly influence the role we play in it. Emotion and motivation interface with almost all areas of psychology and are also highly relevant in connected domains. Terms such as emotion, mood, temperament, but also motivation are often used in ways that reflect our layman's understanding of these phenomena, but that does not take into account the extensive history of scientific research into these concepts. 
This course explores the history and tradition of scientific research on emotion and motivation. The course is to provide students with a solid understanding of the competing theoretical approaches at different levels, ranging from biological and neuroscience approaches to social and cultural concepts. In consequence the successful participants shall have the foundations required to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of applying such concepts various contexts, including in empirical research as well as in various applications. Lastly, they shall be informed of current debates and trends in emotion and motivation research. 
Major theoretical approaches will be presented for emotion and for motivation. In each case there will be an emphasis on critical analysis and discussion of the premises and inconsistencies of the theories in the light of empirical data. The work of specific researchers or specific methods (e.g., measurement of facial activity) will be pursued in more depth. 
 
Major theoretical approaches to emotions: 
 
- Darwinian perspective on emotions. 
- Evolutionary basis of emotions and their expressions: Jamesian Perspective of emotion. 
- Function of physiological changes associated with emotion: Cannon critique of specificity of physiological patterning; mixed models, specifically the Schachter-Singer theory of emotion and associated concepts, such as excitation transfer. 
- Cognitive perspective of emotion: Origin of the modern appraisal construct in the approaches by Arnold and Lazarus, as well as modern multidimensional concepts of appraisal (e.g., Frijda, Smith, Scherer, Roseman); the relationship of cognition and emotion will be discussed particularly in the light of the Lazarus-Zajonc debate; multiple levels of processing. 
- Social-Constructivist Perspective: Different levels of social influence on the definition, experience, and expression of emotions will be discussed (e.g. Averill's theory); display rules, feeling rules, and social schemata of physiological responses. 
 
Major theoretical approaches to motivation: 
 
- History of the motivation concept 
- Biological approaches: Drive concept; examples such as hunger, thirst; physiological underpinnings. 
- Behavioural approaches: Learning theory in relation to motivation (Pavlov, Thorndike, Garcia); innate vs. learned behaviour; species-characteristic stereotyped behaviour. 
- Cognition and emotion: Goals as knowledge structures 
- Motivation and social behaviour: Sociobiology, evolutionary psychology. Cultural perspectives 
- Interaction between emotion and motivation

Name::: 720302 Social Neuroscience
Hours per week::: 3 
Min. | Max. participants::: - | 30 
Instructors::: Elena Tsankova 
Official Course Description:::  Social Neuroscience assumes that the mechanisms underlying mind and behaviour will not be fully explicable by a biological or a social approach alone. Hence, the interactions of different levels of organization, ranging from hormonal and biochemical factors, to the central and peripheral nervous systems, the endocrine and the immune systems, individual differences in behaviour, interpersonal interactions, and social and cultural moderators are the main focus of study. None of these levels is considered the best level of analysis for the understanding of human or animal behaviour. The students shall understand the rationale of and challenges for multi-level analyses and become familiar with examples of such approaches relating to different psychological concepts. This course provides arguments that social and biological approaches are complementary rather than antagonistic. Specifically it will address: 
 
- Philosophical issues regarding the mind-body relationship. 
- Basic concepts of the psychophysiological approach. 
- Social Neuroscience as an extension of the psychophysiological approach. 
- Multilevel integrative analyses of social behaviour. 
- Introduction to the relative functions and structure of autonomic and somatic nervous systems in relationship to the central nervous system. 
- Social cognition and the brain: Basic processes, specific processes, such as the self, perceiving others, social information processing; description of a module in human extrastriate cortex specialized for face perception; voice-selective areas in human auditory cortex; the human amygdala in social judgment. 
- Social Neuroscience of motivation and emotion. 
- Social Neuroscience of attitudes and preferences: For example event-related potentials as indicators of negativity bias; face elicited event-related potentials and tomography analyses of affective attitude. 
- Biology of social relationships and interpersonal processes: Basic processes, specific processes such as attachment, personal ties, affiliation and sexuality, aggression and social order, individual differences in social behaviour. 
- Social influences on biology and health (. e.g., psychoneuroimmunology) 
- Problems of the Social Neuroscience concept. 
- The difficult relationship of social and biological approaches in psychology.

Name::: 730102 Attitudes and Social Cognition
Hours per week::: 3 
Min. | Max. participants::: - | 30 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. J. Christopher Cohrs 
Official Course Description:::  Generally speaking, an attitude is a distinct combination of feelings (affect), inclinations to act (behaviour), and beliefs (cognition). From a layperson's perspective, one might think that an attitude is a stable trait, constituting a person's personality: We know whom we love, we know what we like and this will not change that easily. Historically, this has been the point of view of early psychological research and theorizing. Social Psychological research challenged this notion by providing empirical evidence reflecting the fact that people do not read up their attitudes from an internal meter; rather, attitudes are malleable and flexible and very much dependent on the situation. Given that this is the case, the measurement of attitudes needs a scientific training. It is important to know the methods of how I can get a rather stable opinion from a person instead of a flexible utterance. On the other hand, this sensitivity to context makes it possible that attitudes can be changed. Thus, for example, undesired attitudes leading to unhealthy behaviour can be changed if one understands their nature. 
This course covers the following specific aspects of attitude research: 
 
- Historical developments in attitude research 
- The concept of attitudes: Its cognitive, emotional and behavioural components. 
- The measurement of attitudes: Classic, explicit measures (e.g., questionnaire methods) and implicit measures (e.g., reaction time measures). 
- Situational influences on attitudes. 
- The attitude-behaviour relation: When does an attitude lead to correspondent behaviour? 
- Attitude change. 
- Applications concerning consumer behaviour, person perception, health psychology and personal development.

Name::: 730202 Social Influence
Hours per week::: 3 
Min. | Max. participants::: - | 30 
Instructors::: Dr. Peter Holtz 
Official Course Description:::  Social influence takes place when people change their behaviour caused by real or imagined pressure from others. For instance, we sometimes buy things which we do not really need or even do not want to buy just because we fall prey to a clever advertisement or a smart salesperson. We sometimes behave in certain ways only because others around us do the same thing. Understanding when and why such things happen is the goal of this seminar. 
Social psychologists have considered three major categories of social influence: Conformity, compliance, and obedience. Conformity involves changing one's behaviour to match the responses or actions of others, to fit in with others around. Compliance refers to the act of changing one's behaviour in response to a direct request. Obedience is a special type of compliance that involves changing one's behaviour in response to a directive from an authority figure. 
This seminar explores direct and indirect strategies of social influence. In particular, strategies that make use of the following principles will be discussed: 
 
- The norm of reciprocation: This rule says that people should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided them. 
- Commitment and consistency: Once they make a choice or take a stand, individuals will encounter personal and interpersonal pressure to behave consistently with that commitment. 
- Social proof: People tend to view a behaviour as correct in a given situation to the degree that they see others performing it. 
- Liking: People prefer to say yes to requests of others who they know and like. 
- Authority: People sometimes obey to authority figures and do things they would never have done without the influence of authorities. 
- Scarcity: Opportunities seem more valuable when they are less available, and are, therefore more likely taken. 
 
While this seminar primarily focuses on theoretical explanations and basic research findings in the field of social influence, the implications for various applied settings will be discussed. These include, for instance, advertisement design and consumer behaviour, negotiations in business and oratory techniques in law settings.

Official Course Description:::  Because of the critical importance of energy to a state’s stability and prosperity, energy-related strategies and foreign policy have historically been driven by a mixture of economic and political factors. In recent years, environmental policy - particularly pertaining to global warming - has begun to follow suit. In this course students will gain an understanding of the political dimension of energy and environmental matters through an examination of historical and contemporary examples of geopolitical jostling over energy supply (for example, Central Asia, Asia, Russia, the US, South America, and Europe) and by exploring topics such as energy security, nationalization, resource wars, climate change, and the resource curse. We will also assess the political implications of the shift to renewable energy: are political and energy security concerns likely to remain the same, increase or lessen?

Hours per week::: 3 
Min. | Max. participants::: - | 30 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Karen Smith Stegen 
Official Course Description:::  This course introduces students to the history, theory and current impact of social movements. During the past century, scholars have hotly debated how protest originates and spreads. Can grievance alone sustain prolonged protest? Which types of political systems facilitate or inhibit mobilization? How do activists recruit others to join their cause? These are a few of the many important questions we address in this course, particularly during the first section, when we read and discuss some of the seminal theoretical works of the field. In the second section, we examine the factors associated with social movement success or failure. Why are some movements able to initiate change, whereas other movements flounder and fail? How does government/social control shape outcomes? In the third section, we move beyond theory and analyze one of the most influential case studies in the field: the U.S. civil rights movement. At its zenith, the civil rights movement had several different “wings.” We examine the ideologies and tactics of the various wings, the government’s reactions, and the tensions within the broader movement. The readings include scholarly texts and works by notable civil rights leaders, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. Building on the knowledge gained during the three main sections of the course, we conclude with an examination of recent developments. We assess the impact of modern communication technologies on protest and the role of social movements in a variety of the major issues confronting us today.

Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Steven Michael Ney 
Official Course Description:::  This course introduces the student to the theory and practice of public management and public policy analysis. On the one hand, the course will provide the student with an overview of what public management is today, how it has changed in the past 30 or so years and where it is going. Not only will the course expose students to contemporary thinking in public management, by looking at the way public managers over the world deal with today's policy challanges, the course will also allow students to apply this knowledge to real cases. On the other hand, the course exposes students to the conceptual and methodological tool-box of contemporary policy analysis and, by drawing on real-life examples from a variety of policy domains, shows students how academic and professional policy analysts bring this tool-box to bear on issues of public management and public policy. Additionally, the course will show how different socio-cultural, political or disciplinary frames of references shape policy analysis and how policy analysts can use these frames to sharpen their understanding of the way public institutions are managed.

Name::: 900452 Graduate Seminar (IR): Social Theory and International Relations
Hours per week::: 3 
Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Klaus Schlichte 
Official Course Description:::  This course deals with the most important competing theories, paradigms and metatheoretical orientations in research on international relations, global governance, and globalization, and places them within the context of general social theory. They are thus examined with reference to historical precursors, comparable contemporary phenomena from other social science fields, and general social theory. Realism, institutionalism, constructivism, world systems theory and world society theory all refer back to well-known basic concepts, constructs, principles, or assumptions, and this course will show that a contextualization generates theoretical resources that can be used both to critically analyze the different paradigms and to compare them. This seminar builds on the previous seminar in this module area (Normative Theories of International Order) and on the introduction to the basic elements of theory offered in the first semester course "Theories of Action and Institutions".

Hours per week::: 3 
Min. | Max. participants::: - | - 
Instructors::: Kerstin Martens 
Official Course Description:::  The state is widely considered to be the most important actor in international governance and at the same time a key concept in the social sciences. In recent years it has been argued that profound transformations are taking place which challenge the very foundations of the externally and internally sovereign modern state. The main tendencies of these transformations are the emergence of increasingly autonomous public or private institutions at the international level and the emergence of semi-autonomous functional subsystems and powerful private actors at the domestic level. Governance thus takes place in a complex multi-level system with a variety of public and private actors. The course analyzes these developments, and their consequence for modern governance, both theoretically and by looking in more detail at concrete examples.

Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Adalbert F.X. Wilhelm 
Official Course Description:::  This course aims to provide an introduction to fundamental statistical concepts and tools for data analysis. It is intended as a one-semester course that combines selected topics from both the mandatory statistical methods courses for SHSS students (Statistical Methods I: Exploring Relationships and Comparing Groups and Statistical Methods II: Classification, Modelling and Prediction) to offer the more relevant topics for logistics and SES major students. The course will focus on the understanding of statistical concepts and the application of statistical techniques. While some formulae might be used, no stringent mathematical derivation will be provided. The general objective is to become an intelligent user of the various univariate and multivariate statistical techniques and to acquire the knowledge for deciding which procedure is most suitable for the given business situation. We will discuss the theoretical aspects of the statistical methods, discuss the assumptions for their use, reflect on their limitations and the controversies they create. In practical sessions we will learn how to run the particular procedures using SPSS and/or R, how to interpret the computer output and how to skillfully communicate the results of statistical analyses.

Name::: 990202 Qualitative Research: Methods and Methodology
Hours per week::: 3 
Min. | Max. participants::: - | 70 
Instructors::: Dr. Özen Odag 
Official Course Description:::  Qualitative research is concerned with meaning – for instance, the meaning that events have for people, or the meaning of written texts or works of art. By applying qualitative methods, researchers seek to obtain an in-depth understanding of these meanings. 
 
The course examines the methodological foundations of qualitative research, introduces purposive sampling strategies that are especially suitable for an in-depth discovery of meaning, discusses how researchers from the humanities and social sciences acquire their data (for instance through interviews, focus groups, or observation), and reviews methods for the analysis of qualitative data (such as: various types of coding, content analysis, discourse analysis, visual analysis). Special emphasis is placed on examining the ‘quality of qualitative research‘, including the extent to which the traditional criteria of objectivity, reliability, and validity can be applied. Also, students will develop, carry out, and report on small group research projects, fostering the integration of methodological knowledge about methods and designs with practical expertise in applying these. 
 
The course is held in part as a lecture, in part as workshops, and in part as individual consultations with the instructor. The lectures (taking place on most Mondays of the term) will provide general knowledge about the method in question. During the workshops (taking place on Mondays and Wednesdays), students are required to participate in activities involving the application of selected methods to data from their own fields of study. The individual consultations with the instructor (tbd) provide the students with individual feedback on the group research projects and make sure that the students are on the right track.

Thus, one focus of the course consists of quantitative methods used in economy and business. We will expand on the knowledge acquired in the statistics class and intensify discussion of multiple regression analysis, in particualr with an emphasis on longitudinal/time dependent data. The second focus of the course is on the analysis of large data sets that are created during the regular business process, such as billing data, customer information, etc.; data, that is more and more analysed by computer-intensive methods to find structure and patterns. 
The general objective is to become familiar with classic and contemporary methods that are used in econometric and business analyses and to become a critical reader of case studies in this field. We will take a practical approach to learn how to run the particular procedures in state of the art software. To foster the practical approach homeworks and projects will be assigned. By the end of this course, students will know the rules for being competent practitioners of econometrics. This involves: 
Understanding how data should be organized for undertaking econometric modeling and the steps required for preparing data for analysis; Recognizing what technique to select from the econometric toolkit given the pattern of values in the data; Being able to interpret results with respect to both their statistical and economic/social significance; Be able to cast a skeptical eye on econometric results in the literature; Have fun working with social science data

Name::: APS083 Effective Communication Strategies (0,1 credits)
Min. | Max. participants::: 5 | 10 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Sonia Lippke 
Official Course Description:::  Whenever we talk to other people, misunderstandings may arise, even if we use exactly the same language, and even if we have no intercultural variations. This is due to the fact that people communicate from different perspectives, which might cause confusion and misinterpretation. How can we communicate effectively? In discussions, how can we help others become aware of issues we want them to be conscious about? How can we give constructive feedback? In this course, we will review different approaches and strategies, such as motivational interviewing. Plenty of time is devoted to practical training in pairs, small groups and in a (relatively) large assembly. All students will have the chance to experience providing, receiving and observing interpersonal support.

Min. | Max. participants::: - | 30 
Instructors::: Prof. Dr. Adalbert F.X. Wilhelm 
Official Course Description:::  This course aims to provide an overview and understanding of some of the more commonly used and applied statistical techniques.
