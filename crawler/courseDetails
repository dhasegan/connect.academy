There is, nevertheless, the common understanding that each society has law and that the function of such law is providing rules for the organisation of that society, including the behaviour of its members. \n \nListening to ordinary voices, we hear that certain behaviour is called unethical, or immoral. This can happen when somebody acts in a specific way, which is seen to be in violation of ethical standards or moral obligations, or a person does not act at all although he / she was expected to act. For some, including scholars of philosophy, ethics and moral (and / or the morals) are used interchangeable. Others draw a distinction between ethics and moral. According to this, ethics is part of philosophy and as such the meta-level which reflects on norms, be them legal or non-legal. In this sense, the moral norms in a society, which are not necessarily included in the respective legal order, are subject of ethics. \n \nEthics reflects normative perceptions. Ethical discourses collect and research the social foundation of moral perception. Ethics describes, questions, reasons, substantiates and develops normative perceptions, standards and rules. The various theories of ethics, theories reaching from Aristotle to Kant, from Rawls to modern proponents of hermeneutical ethics contribute to the vast field of ethics in their specific manner. Ethical reflections explore the viability of the ethical instruments submitted by ethical theory for the ethical solution of problems, including problems described as ethical dilemmas. However, the bigger part of the ethical discourse focuses on approaches to ethics in the philosophy of the western world and, with this, addresses the Western move to the secular state and the subsequent emphasis on (secular) ethics. Questions about ethics and the relationship of ethics and law in other frames of thoughts, e.g. the Islamic, the African or the Chinese frame of thought, in particular, require attention when problems arising from cultural diversities have to be dealt with. \n \n Teaching credits (non-public):\n 2", "Credits": "5.00", "Catalogue": "University Studies Courses", "CourseName": "Law and Ethics (TDC)", "Course Name Abbreviation": "020088", "Type": "Seminar"}, {"Partial Grades": "", "Name": "020089 USC - Society and Technology", "Min. | Max. participants": "- | 50", "Instructors": "Prof. Dr. Thomas Heine; Prof. Dr. Klaus Schmann", "CourseID": "020089", "Official Course Description": "Surely new technology is constantly shaping societies, but how about the reverse causality of how societies shape, facilitate or impede modern technologies?

The assessment of the explanatory power of reductionism is a controversial issue, even between two Nobel prize winners from physics, Steven Weinberg and Phil Anderson. We shall first illustrate reductionisms success in different areas of physics: relativity theory, gauge theories of the standard \nmodel, self-organized processes like pattern formation in cosmology, the renormalization group approach in condensed matter theory, and more generally topics of multi-scale modeling. The success becomes possible due to a few guiding principles, the exploitation of symmetries, but also due to large-scale computer simulations. Therefore one may be tempted to jump to conclusions and postulate the existence of a world formula or a theory of everything, such postulates are found in the literature until recently. Pointing out the \nlimitations of reductionism in the second part of the course, it will become clear why such postulates are not meaningful. Limitations show up when the goal is to predict not only a single aspect, but the whole variety of emergent phenomena on a higher level of description when starting from a more fundamental one. We shall also review the very formulation of physical laws in stochastic and deterministic versions, the increasing complexity in the description that one has to face if \nthe goal is to capture distinct aspects at the same time. Along with a comparison of stochastic and deterministic formulations, an important topic in the theory of evolution will be discussed. It is related to the role of contingency and necessity in time evolutions, in particular in the evolution of the universe. Here well-known representatives of opposing viewpoints are the paleontologists and biologists S. J. Gould and S. C. Morris. The reviews on topics from physics will be supplemented by some presentations from the philosophical side, discussing \ntheories of explanation in physics and biology. From illustrations of the successful application of reductionism in different branches of physics, undergraduate students are expected to receive first reviews on achievements rather than a detailed understanding. A deeper understanding can be gained upon specialization on the graduate level.

Attention will also be given to the preconditions of industrial growth in the agricultural and commercial economy of early-modern Europe. The history of economic processes has begun to include not just production, but also trade and consumption, as modern societies are increasingly defined as \"consumer societies\". In addition, the \"cultural turn\" has had its impact also on economic history, leading to a new emphasis on economic action, economic ideology, and the cultural implications of economic behavior. The lecture provides an overview over both classical and new topics in modern economic history, from early-modern beginnings to postwar economies after 1945 and issues of economic \"globalization\", and at the same time introduces students to different ways of conceptualizing past economies.

Christopher Cohrs", "CourseID": "730102", "Official Course Description": "Generally speaking, an attitude is a distinct combination of feelings (affect), inclinations to act (behaviour), and beliefs (cognition). From a layperson's perspective, one might think that an attitude is a stable trait, constituting a person's personality: We know whom we love, we know what we like and this will not change that easily. Historically, this has been the point of view of early psychological research and theorizing. Social Psychological research challenged this notion by providing empirical evidence reflecting the fact that people do not read up their attitudes from an internal meter; rather, attitudes are malleable and flexible and very much dependent on the situation. Given that this is the case, the measurement of attitudes needs a scientific training. It is important to know the methods of how I can get a rather stable opinion from a person instead of a flexible utterance. On the other hand, this sensitivity to context makes it possible that attitudes can be changed. Thus, for example, undesired attitudes leading to unhealthy behaviour can be changed if one understands their nature. \nThis course covers the following specific aspects of attitude research: \n \n- Historical developments in attitude research \n- The concept of attitudes: Its cognitive, emotional and behavioural components. \n- The measurement of attitudes: Classic, explicit measures (e.g., questionnaire methods) and implicit measures (e.g., reaction time measures). \n- Situational influences on attitudes. \n- The attitude-behaviour relation: When does an attitude lead to correspondent behaviour? \n- Attitude change. \n- Applications concerning consumer behaviour, person perception, health psychology and personal development.", "Credits": "5.00", "Catalogue": "School of Humanities and Social Sciences > Psychology > Undergraduate Level Courses", "CourseName": "Attitudes and Social Cognition", "Course Name Abbreviation": "Attitudes", "Type": "Seminar", "Additional Information": "This is a mandatory course for the following BA programs: Integrated Social and Cognitive Psychology (ISCP) and Intercultural Relations and Behavior (IRB). \n- ISCP students take this course in spring 1 (semester 2). \n- IRB students take this course in spring 1 (semester 2). \n \nPriority at registration will be given to the above mentioned cohort(s) of students.

For instance, we sometimes buy things which we do not really need or even do not want to buy just because we fall prey to a clever advertisement or a smart salesperson. We sometimes behave in certain ways only because others around us do the same thing. Understanding when and why such things happen is the goal of this seminar. \nSocial psychologists have considered three major categories of social influence: Conformity, compliance, and obedience. Conformity involves changing one's behaviour to match the responses or actions of others, to fit in with others around. Compliance refers to the act of changing one's behaviour in response to a direct request. Obedience is a special type of compliance that involves changing one's behaviour in response to a directive from an authority figure. \nThis seminar explores direct and indirect strategies of social influence. In particular, strategies that make use of the following principles will be discussed: \n \n- The norm of reciprocation: This rule says that people should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided them. \n- Commitment and consistency: Once they make a choice or take a stand, individuals will encounter personal and interpersonal pressure to behave consistently with that commitment. \n- Social proof: People tend to view a behaviour as correct in a given situation to the degree that they see others performing it. \n- Liking: People prefer to say yes to requests of others who they know and like. \n- Authority: People sometimes obey to authority figures and do things they would never have done without the influence of authorities. \n- Scarcity: Opportunities seem more valuable when they are less available, and are, therefore more likely taken. \n \nWhile this seminar primarily focuses on theoretical explanations and basic research findings in the field of social influence, the implications for various applied settings will be discussed.

At its zenith, the civil rights movement had several different wings. We examine the ideologies and tactics of the various wings, the governments reactions, and the tensions within the broader movement.
