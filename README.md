===============

Ahoy Sailor,

Welcome aboard! You about to begin a journey that will revolutionize education forever. But first things first: Preparation.

- `git clone https://github.com/dhasegan/connect.academy.git`
- `cd connect.academy/`
- `make install`
- `make setup` # starts venv, setup the db and add some data
  !Important: make sure Connect's env variables are not in your ~/.bashrc
- `./manage.py runserver` # Starts local development app

That's it, the server should be running. Now, buckle up! Ocean winds are cruel and most men don't survive.
