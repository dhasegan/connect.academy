Ahoy Sailor,

Welcome aboard! You about to begin a journey that will revolutionize education forever. But first things first: Preparation.

- Learn how to use Google
- Clone the git repository
- cd into connect.academy/
- Run "make install" - (also installs virtualenv)
- Wait for shell_plus to be launched
- On shell_plus, run "Populator.populate_xsmall()" (some errors might happen :))
- Ignore errors, and type "exit" (on shell_plus)
That's it, the server should be running. Now, buckle up! Ocean winds are cruel and most men don't survive.
