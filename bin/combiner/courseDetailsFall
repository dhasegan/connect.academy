Students will learn about inter- and intraindividual differences in biological, psychological, and social aging, how adaptive competencies and learning abilities develop over the lifespan and how adaptation to internal and external factors allows healthy and successful aging. Also different types of interventions for enabling successful aging will be discussed. We will always focus on neurobiological and behavior results as well as on the development of brain and body.",

        "Official Course Description": "The course is a seminar with a component of creativity and research workshops. The seminar addresses a major problem, and open question in transdisciplinary research, namely the relation and connection between visuals, their perception, reception, interpretation, but also their production, and empathy as a (not only) human capacity to connect to others, to identify, but also to distinguish oneself from others. There are strong indications from various disciplines \u0096 philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, biology, neuroscience, media and communication, art history as well as applied therapy and visual design that there is an intrinsic connection between the sense of seeing/vision, and an empathetic or apathetic reaction to these visuals. The course explores this connection and its consequences from transdisciplinary perspectives with the aim of developing transdisciplinary research projects in research teams in the area of \u0093Visual Empathy\u0094.",

Concerning forms and structures the main focus will be on extension and expansion. \n \nTopics will be chosen according to current issues in German society. Extracts from literature or important texts relating to German history or politics will also be used, as the focus will be on German culture as a whole, past and present. \n \nFor example, we will discuss issues of social life. We will also study the historical anniversary of the destruction of the wall of Berlin, the dispositions, purposes and consequences for people living in East and West Germany. \n \nIn literature, we will work with the play of Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt`s \u0093Die Physiker\u0094, alluding to issues concerning life of human beings being part of society. \n \nWe will also analyse academic language as used in scientific texts, for example \u0093Partizipialkonstruktionen\u0094 and \u0093Nominalisierung\u0094. \n \nMaterials: articles from newspapers or similar, radio features, short pieces of literature, film, music etc. \n \n \nAfter completing the level C1 successfully, you can take the corresponding Goethe language examination \u0093Goethe Zertifikat C1\u0094 at the Goethe Institute in Bremen. Please check the website \n \nfor details on the examination \u0093Goethe Zertifikat C1\u0094: \nhttp://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/bes/gc1/enindex.htm \n \nfor details on times and fees: \nhttp://www.goethe.de/ins/de/ort/bre/prf/zc1/deindex.htm \n \n \n \nFor a detailed description of all language levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages check the Goethe website: \n \nhttp://www.goethe.de/z/50/commeuro/ \n \n \nTextbook: No textbook",

The aim of this class is to provide a view on the French and the francophone culture, discuss it and compare it with the students\u0092 cultural backgrounds. We will work on press articles, abstract of novels or films on a variety of topics such as shared apartments, music festivals and university or work environment in France and francophone countries. At the end of the B1 level, students should be able to cope with most of the situations one might be faced to on a trip in a country where French is spoken. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to, for example, describe your academic background to a future employer (use of past tenses), give your point of view and debate on a variety of subjects (different ways of expressing consequences, aims\u0085) or help you to understand the main points of a radio or a TV broadcast.",

You will learn how to fulfill simple everyday life tasks in Spanish. For example, amongst other competences, you will be able to introduce yourself in a professional or a personal setting, to book a ticket, understand somebody indicating you an itinerary or order something in a restaurant. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to perform concrete tasks: describe your activities, your habits, understand a cooking recipe or talk about your hobbies. Individual and group tasks will be carried out (interviews) so that students will be able to practice what they have learnt. \n \nAttending these courses you can reach language level A1. Furthermore, after completing these courses successfully, you can take the corresponding DELE A1 examination at the Instituto Cervantes in Bremen.

The aim is to provide a view on the Spanish and the Latin American cultures, discuss it and compare it with the students\u0092 cultural backgrounds. We will work on press articles, abstract of novels or films on a variety of topics such as shared apartments, music festivals and university or work environment in Spain and Latin America. At the end of the B1 level, students should be able to cope with most of the situations one might be faced to on a trip in a country where Spanish is spoken. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to, for example, describe your academic background to a future employer (use of past tenses), give your point of view and debate on a variety of subjects (different ways of expressing consequences, aims\u0085) or help you to understand the main points of a radio or a TV broadcast. Also we will read a short novel. And we might go to watch a movie. \nStudents attending these courses can reach language level B1 (according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). Furthermore, after a successful completion of these courses, you can take the corresponding DELE B1 examination at the Instituto Cervantes in Bremen.

After attending the course, participants should build up a vocabulary of at least 500 words, grasp 300 characters and important grammar structures. \n \nThe textbook for the course is New Practice Chinese Reader (2002), published by Beijing Language and Culture Press in China.

Furthermore, the principal properties and applications of simple components (resistors, capacitors, inductances, diodes, Bipolar and FET transistors, Integrated circuits) will be covered. The theoretical concepts are deepened by ``hands on experience'' in the NatSciLab Electrical Engineering I, which is mandatory. The course is planned in such a manner that students should, as a rule, also take Electrical Engineering II in the Spring term. However, the course can also serve as a ``stand alone'' course within the shell model. The choice of what is taught (and to which depth) in General EE I and General EE II and their associated Lab Courses concentrates on those areas with high relevance for main stream and future EE developments.",

The lab course is offered in conjunction with the course on Signals and Systems (300201). The concepts of signals and systems are generic and applications can be found in several areas like communications, speech and image processing, or process control. The goal of the lab is to apply these concepts by a combined approach of experiments and simulations. The experiments will provide the students with practical experience and allow the students to relate the experiments to signals and systems theory. \nTopics: \nStep response of RLC circuits, filters (RLC circuits), fourier transform and fourier series, sampling, digital filters, modulation, control experiment.",

The counter-intuitive behavior \ncomes from nonlinear interactions between the system components and the nonlinear processing \nof incoming information. This course is an introduction to nonlinear dynamics and control \nwith a focus on a broad range of applications. Topics include: \n1. Low dimensional autonomous dynamical systems: formulation as differential equation, \nflow, fixed points, stability, stability criteria, potentials and Lyapunov functionals, simple local \nbifurcations (saddle-node, pitchfork, transcritical, cusp, Hopf), simple numerical schemes, \ntime-discrete maps (fixed points, stability), introduction to chaos. \n2. Control for linear systems: general matrix-based solution for driven linear ODEs, reachability, \ncontrollability, observability, Gram-matrix for determining control laws and for reconstruction, \nlinear-state feedback controller, stable-state estimation, introduction to optimal control. \n3. Reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (activator-inhibitor, relations to control), \nstability of stationary solutions, Turing instability.",

This shows that this is an emerging field. It builds on radio engineering, digital communications, computer networks and protocols, distributed systems, information management, and applications. Most of these topics are taught in other specialization courses mainly within this major, but also within other majors. This course will equip students with the basic knowledge in wireless communications and radio system engineering. It will make the physical limitations of communications technologies understandable to the computer scientist, while making the system architecture and technology accessible to the electrical engineer.",

It is estimated that about 10\\% of all EE engineers work in microelectronics industry and their suppliers, and a much larger percentage depends directly or indirectly on a basic knowledge of microelectronics technology and production methods. It is therefore the objective of the course to provide an overview of the field. Topics to be covered are: production and quality of semiconductor materials; IC manufacturing technology; unit processes (photolithography, dry and wet etching, \nhot processes, layer deposition, assembly, testing) process integration, quality management, industrial engineering. In many of these topics, EE and CS competencies are applied. - A more thorough treatment of the subject on the key areas will be offered within the graduate program.",

The course provides an analytical framework for modeling and evaluating \npoint-to-point and multi-point communication. \nAfter a short rehearsal of probability and random variables and some excursion to random \nnumber generation, the key concept of information content of a signal source and information \ncapacity of a transmission medium are precisely defined, and their relationships to data compression \nalgorithms and error control codes are examined in detail. The course aims to install \nan appreciation for the fundamental capabilities and limitations of information transmission \nschemes and to provide the mathematical tools for applying these ideas to a broad class of \ncommunications systems. \nAside from source and channel aspects, an introduction to security is given, including publickey \ncryptography. \nInformation theory is standard in every communications-oriented Bachelor\u0092s program.",

        "Official Course Description": "As the feature size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink at a staggering rate, the increasing degree of integration allows very complex digital systems to be realized on a single chip. Such systems can either be fabricated in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) using very high scale integration (VLSI) techniques or implemented in programmable devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In both cases, very large designs are partitioned into a hierarchy of logical blocks, and by adhering to a set of standard design rules, the difficulty of integrating these blocks is dramatically reduced. The most popular approach is synchronous design with register transfer level (RTL) logic, but asynchronous designs are also possible. \n \nAlthough digital systems were traditionally designed at the schematic level, the current trend is towards hardware description languages (HDLs) that allow compact description of very complex hardware constructs. The appearance of sophisticated automatic hardware synthesis engines that implement logic directly from HDL have made HDLs the choice for new logic designs. Although the target language of this class is VHDL, other languages such as Verilog and SystemC apply the same design strategies. This course stresses the importance of viewing HDL as a way of describing real hardware, and not \"just another programming language\".",

Based on clear mathematical foundations (which are developed \nas needed) the course discusses abstract and concrete notions of computing machines, \ninformation, and algorithms, focusing on the question of representation vs. meaning in Computer \nScience. \nTo have a theoretical notion of computation, we introduce inductively defined structures, term \nrepresentations, abstract interpretation via equational substitution. This is contrasted with a \nfirst concrete model of computation: Standard ML, which will also act as the primary programming \nlanguage for the course. We cover a basic subset of ML that includes types, recursion, \ntermination, lists, strings, higher-order programming, effects, and exceptions. Back on the \ntheoretical side, we cover string codes, formal languages, Boolean expressions (syntax) and \nBoolean Algebras (semantics). The course introduces elementary complexity theory (big-O), \napplying it to analyzing the gate-complexity of Boolean Expressions (prime implicants and \nQuine McCluskey\u0092s algorithm).",

        "Official Course Description": "The course provides a foundation in the theory and applications of digital image processing. The first part will concentrate on morphological image processing, which is one of the most powerful tool sets in dealing with digital images and it is the backbone of many of today's high-performance image analysis systems. We will start on basic concepts of dilation, erosion, geodesic transformations, morphological filtering, and watershed transform, and will develop into advanced strategies for image segmentation and texture analysis. The second part of the course will concentrate on solving problems from biomedical, environmental, and industrial imaging, and will provide an overview of the broader field of image processing. As prerequisites either Signals and Systems Lab (300221) or Software Engineering Lab (320222) are accepted. The course can be combined with Digital Signal Processing (300302).",

        "Official Course Description": "Machine learning (ML) is all about algorithms which are fed with (large quantities of) real-world data, and which return a compressed ``model'' of the data. An example is the ``world model'' of a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its environment -- needed, for instance, for navigation. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings, from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech recognition systems. There is a large number of formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally large diversity of learning algorithms. However, there is a relatively small number of fundamental challenges which are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms: most notably, the ``curse of dimensionality'' and the almost deadly-dangerous problem of under- vs.\\ overfitting. This lecture introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, mixtures of Gaussians, Parzen windows). Furthermore, the course also provides an intense refresher of the requisite concepts from probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.",

        "Official Course Description": "Model-order reduction methods explore ways in which the complexity of the mathematical models of physical systems can be reduced for the purposes of expedient, yet accurate, computer-aided analysis. Recently, these methods are being pursued by the electromagnetics and circuits computer-aided design (CAD) communities in their efforts to develop efficient modeling tools capable of tackling the escalating complexity of the design and virtual prototyping of integrated mixed-signal systems. \nThis course offers a comprehensive view of the development and application of model-order reduction methods in the analysis and CAD of complex circuits and systems. \n \nIn particular, the first half of the course will be dedicated to the fundamentals of linear dynamical systems, their representation both in state space and input-output terms, and their approximation. \nThe methods developed will then be applied to model-order reduction for large linear circuits arising in modeling the interconnection networks in high-density integrated circuits. Applications include the reduction of both lumped RLC and transmission-line-based circuit models. \n \nThe course is based on the book: \"Approximation of large-scale systems\", by A.C. Antoulas, published by SIAM, Philadelphia, 2005.",

        "Official Course Description": "Typically, an antenna is the interface between the transceiver frontend and the free space. Antennas are used in many different applications, where mobile communication is only one, although, one of the most important ones. In many cases it is the antenna that causes some trouble (dysfunction, disconnection, etc.) if not properly designed and realized (maybe you remember the trouble with Apple's iPhone 4 antenna in 2010). Therefore, engineers who are working in the wireless business have to know about the working principles of antennas. \nThe course is organized as follows. After an introduction (chapter 1) we will recapitulate the Maxwell's Equations (chapter 2) and the basics of electromagnetic waves and their main characteristics. \nThese topics are foundational for understanding antenna theory. In chapter 4 the basic method for dealing with antenna problems is introduced which is the method of vector potentials calculated by a given antenna current that causes radiation in the transmit mode (or that is induced if the antenna is receiving). The Hertzian dipole and the electrically small loop antenna (i.e., a magnetic \ndipole) are calculated as the very first and very basic antennas. After that, the most important terms and definitions are introduced, i.e., radiation characteristic (beam pattern), directivity, gain, efficiency, path loss, half power beamwidth, and EIRP. In chapter 5 we calculate linear antennas, here, dipole antennas of different electrical lengths. Chapter 6 is devoted to array antennas and the calculation of the array factor. Exemplarily, different array configurations consisting of half-wavelength dipoles are considered. This deepens the understanding of how beamforming, nulling, etc. \ncan be realized by so called phased array antennas. \nIn chapter 7 aperture antennas are discussed. For that, the method of equivalent sources is introduced. This theory is then applied to horn antennas and slot antennas followed by parabolic reflector antennas and lens antennas. \nFinally, microstrip patch antennas and patch antenna arrays are investigated.",

In order to obtain the basic foundation for digital communications, the course discusses matched filter, whitened matched filter, equalizer structures (linear, DFE, Tomlinson-Harashima) and equalizer adaptation with zero forcing and MMSE/LMS.We will apply these concepts to baseband and single-carrier transmission. Multicarrier transmission (OFDM/DMT) as the most current technology in wireline and wireless transmission will be treated thoroughly. \nThe wireline channel will be highlighted. Starting from channel properties of twisted pair and coaxial cables, all current wireline transmission methods will be studied in detail. Although the focus will be on twisted-pair transmission, cable modems (including hybrid fiber-coax) will be touched, as well. In xDSL and cable modems, we find almost every transmission method, like PAM, QAM, CAP, and multicarrier.",

Convex problems are more general than linear ones but although convex optimization is about non-linear problems, optimum solutions are still globally optimal. The course is an introduction to the theory and application of convex optimization. It provides a wide variety of examples and discusses different optimization algorithms.",

        "Official Course Description": "Machine learning (ML) is all about algorithms which are fed with (large quantities of) real-world data, and which return a compressed ``model'' of the data. An example is the ``world model'' of a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its environment -- needed, for instance, for navigation. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings, from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech recognition systems. There is a large number of formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally large diversity of learning algorithms. However, there is a relatively small number of fundamental challenges which are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms: most notably, the ``curse of dimensionality'' and the almost deadly-dangerous problem of under- vs.\\ overfitting. This lecture introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, mixtures of Gaussians, Parzen windows). Furthermore, the course also provides an intense refresher of the requisite concepts from probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.",

We will introduce \nthe syntax and semantics of first-order logic, and discuss calculi, soundness, completeness \non this system. We will cover machine-oriented inference calculi like analytic tableaux, and \nresolution and apply them to theorem proving and logic programming applications. \nWe will discuss the non-deductive reasoning modes of abduction and induction and briefly \nintroduce computational methods for mechanizing them. Finally, we will give an introduction \nto knowledge representation and description logics, leading to an introduction of \"semantic \nweb\" techniques.",

Students pursue advanced projects, which, while utilizing concepts and techniques practiced in the DBWA homeworks, transcend these homework projects in demand and complexity. \nTypically, these projects are derived from and contribute to international collaborations and the research group's standardization work in geo services and SQL. Hence, successful projects become visible internationally to large-scale data centers .Further, as part of the final reporting a scientific conference publication is foreseen, which, following acceptance, will be presented by the students. \nStudents receive individual coaching on their technical work and scientific publiching, and additionally are offered in-depth training on speech and presentation techniques to cope with manifold situations.",

The course commences with a comparative study of the structure and function of sense organs, emphasizing that an understanding of an animal's behaviour is impossible without a detailed knowledge of the sense organs. Various aspects of intra- and interspecific behaviours, e.g., orientation, feeding, territoriality, courtship, etc. are then explained, before predominantly ecological aspects (e.g., competition, parasitism, pest control, etc.) wrap up the course.",

Biorhythms ae the basis for adaptation to varying environmental factors. Virtually all organisms including single cells express such rhythms. During the lecture, students will learn the basic principles o rhythm generating systems and their importance for the life sciences.",

        "Further Grading Information": "Final grade will depend on: a research project (30%), several unannounced quizzes based on previous course matters (all quizzes together will account for 25% of the final grade), and homeworks and individual course presentation (25%). The remaining 20% will be based on regular participation in the discussions, quality of contributions, and class attendance (missing more than two classes without valid excuse will lead to deductions). \n \nCourse presentations (1-2) on research papers related to the course matters and mandatory readings of the respective class will be given by each student at some point during the semester. The presentations will summarize the introduction, methods, results and critically evaluate a scientific paper assigned to you (15 minutes in total). The following discussion will be led by the presenter. Each student in the auditorium should prepare 2-3 questions/comments for the discussion in advance. For one or two classes written home work will be requested. More details will be given in class and alternative formats might be offered. \n \nFor the research project, you will do a literature search on a self-defined topic, write a brief report, and present your findings in class. More information about formal requirements and procedures will be announced during the course. The report will be submitted via Turnitin for check of plagiarism. Any violation of the Code of Academic Integrity will lead to a fail. \n \nQuizzes will be in the form of multiple-choice or true/false questions and given at the beginning of a course. If you are late and miss the quiz, all questions will be counted as \u0093false\u0094. About 5 quizzes will be distributed during the semester and they will be graded in total. \n \nActive participation in class includes, for example, discussion of lectures and presentations on basis of pre-formulated questions, application of presented concepts to real-life situations, or other transfer activities. \n \nStudents may earn extra credit for the course by participating in research opportunities announced in class or by other means. Research opportunities must be approved by the instructor in order to count toward extra credit. Once the student participates, it is each student\u0092s responsibility to notify the instructor of his/her participation in these projects immediately after his/her participation (one/two days) even if researchers say they will notify the instructor. To notify the instructor, send an e-mail that contains the name of the study and the date that you participated.",

        "Official Course Description": "This advanced course will add a lifespan developmental neuroscience perspective to topics previously covered in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Biological (e.g. genetic) and contextual (e.g. experience) influences on brain development over the lifespan are addressed. Plasticity of the brain across the lifespan is emphasized. Plasticity is the ability of the nervous system to respond to changed demands and, thus, underlies learning and adaptive behavior. Development of the cerebral cortex and behavioral outcomes are explored in the context of environmental effects that can amplify or inhibit adaptive capacity. Neural malleability is maximal in early development, but the capacity for change in the nervous system is maintained throughout life including old age. Normal age development of the brain is contrasted to pathological changes that appear in some diseases of old age. Consequences of normal and non-normal development and aging and the influence of lifestyle factors (e.g., a physically active lifestyle, continued education) are discussed. Students will leave the course with an understanding of brain-behavior-environment interactions in lifespan developmental outcomes. Students will train their research, presentation and writing skills by critically evaluating scientific evidence.",

It is an integrated part of the lab rotations each student has to attend during the 3rd year education. Two lab rotations per each semesterof the 3rd year will give the students the opportunity to visit four different research laboratories of the various life sciences disciplines participating (see above for a list of participating PI's) in this course structure. All individual lab rotations will finally be written up in a thesis to prove the student's ability of performing independent research. Scheduling has to be decided between the Students and the individual Instructors of the particular lab rotations. The Instructors of Record of the BC+CB, Bio, BI+CB, and BCE 3rd year lab courses I and II will have to organize for accommodation of each student within the research laboratories preferably of their first choices. However, this needs to be done in a way to allow equal and appropriate distribution of all students between the various research groups. Students will indicate their preferences, and the Instructors of Record will decide on the order of lab rotations during the 3rd year. To enable the students with the necessary information on which lab to choose, an information evening will be organized at the end of the 4th semester. Students are urged to attend.",

At the end of the course, you will have gained knowledge of the foundations and the scope of the subject and of the specific scientific reasoning that underlies research in this field. Topics covered will be the biochemistry and biophysics of DNA, proteins (especially enzymes), carbohydrates, and lipids; the buildup and the breakdown of these substances; the (animal, plant, and bacterial) cell, its substructure, and its organelles; an introduction to the most common chemical reactions in living cells and the underlying thermodynamic, chemical, and kinetic principles, including metabolism and its regulation; and introductory overviews of specialized fields such as biophysics, structural biology, molecular machines, molecular neurobiology, immunology, molecular genetics, developmental biology, and cancer. Information about the techniques and strategies to obtain knowledge and to ask questions in molecular life science, as well as historical outlines, will accompany each topic. This course requires solid High School knowledge of both biology and chemistry, or the willingness to acquire it at Jacobs University. Depending on their previous training, prospective Biochemistry and Cell Biology major students are advised to take General Chemistry or General Biology or both in addition to this course. General Biochemical Engineering is also a very useful complement.",

        "Official Course Description": "The course intends to give a detailed understanding of the chemical reactions that underlie life. In the first part the structures, dynamics and chemistry of important biomolecules will be described. The thermodynamics and kinetics of ligand binding to proteins and enzyme catalysis will be explained and enzymatic catalysis explored at the molecular and atomic level. The second part focuses on metabolism and describes how energy is produced by living organisms and how the molecules of life are synthesised and degraded. A special focus will be set on common principles and the integration of the metabolism. The third part of the course explains how the genetic information stored in the DNA sequence is maintained and expressed. In addition the mechanism of DNA binding and modification by proteins and enzymes will be presented. The techniques of modern molecular biology will be described and the results of the human genome project discussed.",

Cells are limited by a plasma membrane bearing important functions like communication of cells with their surroundings. Within eukaryotic cells, biological membranes form cellular compartments to optimize biochemical reactions necessary for all cells to perform their biological functions. The biogenesis of cellular compartments will be a central part on the way of understanding the evolution of multicellular organisms. The complexity of cellular systems and of their macromolecular constituents becomes most obvious in certain dysorders which have been characterized on the molecular level. Therefore, biomedical implications will be included whereever possible.",

Besides a detailed view into general microbiology and microbial ecology, the course deals with molecular aspects of evolution, microbiology, and plant cell biology and physiology. Therefore, special emphasis will be given to environmental, microbial, and \"green\" biology. This includes exciting insights into molecular aspects of the interactions between living organisms, such as symbiosis, infectious diseases, and global element cycles. While three modules within the fall semester will cover the fields of Molecular Evolution, General Microbiology (incl. bacteria, protists, and fungi), and Microbial Ecology (incl. element cycles, symbiosis, and pathology), the three modules of the spring \nsemester will bring insights into Molecular Biology of Plant Cells, Plant Eco-physiology, and Plant and Microbial Genetics. Additionally, all modules will highlight how we can explore our knowledge of microbial and plant molecular biology at the level of biotechnology.",

One lab rotation in each semester of the 3rd year will give the students the opportunity to work in a research laboratory of one of the various life sciences disciplines participating (see list of instructors). Both lab rotations will be written up in a thesis to prove the student's ability of performing guided research. Scheduling has to be decided between the students and the individual instructors of the particular lab rotations. The Instructor of Record will have to organize accommodation of the students within the research laboratories preferably of their first choices. However, this needs to be done in a way allowing equal and appropriate distribution of all students between the various research groups. To provide information about the research topics and how the course will be conducted, a meeting with the instructors will be organized at the end of the 4th semester. It is strongly recommended that all prospective 3rd year BCCB-students attend this information session.",

        "Official Course Description": "The course intends to give a detailed understanding of the chemical reactions that underlie life. In the first part the structures, dynamics and chemistry of important biomolecules will be described. The thermodynamics and kinetics of ligand binding to proteins and enzyme catalysis will be explained and enzymatic catalysis explored at the molecular and atomic level. The second part focuses on metabolism and describes how energy is produced by living organisms and how the molecules of life are synthesised and degraded. A special focus will be set on common principles and the integration of the metabolism. The third part of the course explains how the genetic information stored in the DNA sequence is maintained and expressed. In addition the mechanism of DNA binding and modification by proteins and enzymes will be presented. The techniques of modern molecular biology will be described and the results of the human genome project discussed.",

        "Official Course Description": "One of the most challenging tasks in modern science is to design the optimal experimental strategy to unravel the fascinating complexity of biological systems. On one hand, this strategy may involve the isolation and characterization of a single macromolecule, on the other hand it could require the genetic manipulation and functional analysis of a whole organism. This course provides a problem-oriented introduction to important experimental methods employed in modern Molecular Life Sciences. The participants will learn about advantages and limitations of a broad spectrum of different techniques in biochemistry, molecular biology and cell biology. Research Strategies will be developed based on both, solving fictitious problems in theory and by analyzing current scientific literature. At the end of the course, students will write their own research proposal to analyze a given scientific problem.",

The increasing amount of biological data in particular \nof protein and DNA sequences requires students to gain practical experience with algorithms \nand computational tools for sequence analysis. The lab course intends to train students in \nthe application of computational approaches to nucleic acid and protein sequence analysis and \nsecondary structure prediction. The script language Perl will be introduced and students will \nbe trained to write own applications and to program bioinformatics algorithms and methods. It \nwill give a practical introduction and an overview on available and frequently applied sequence \nanalysis methods including the software to align and compare sequences and to predict coding \nand non-coding regions. Multiple alignment methods will be used to align several sequences \nand to identify conserved elements. In addition, computational methods for the prediction of \nprotein and RNA secondary structure will be introduced and applied to selected examples. The \ngeneration of a SQL data base in combination with a script language will be introduced. \nPart 2: Genomics. In the second part of the lab course (Genomics) hands on in genome \nanalysis will be obtained. Starting with a students seminar on a special topic related to genome \nresearch every week, several tools will be tested and used for sequence analysis. We will use \nweb-bases systems as well as standalone tools installed on a local server. Complete genomes as \nwell as genomic fragments will be analysed. The genomic fragments will serve as the template \nfor in depth annotation using an open source annotation system (GenDB). A local installation \nof the phylogenetic software package ARB will be used for phylogenetic inference and tree \nreconstruction of selected functional genes.",

However, the developments in molecular biology have given biotechnology new meaning, new prominence, and new potential. (= modern biotechnology). Therefore, the course predominantly focuses on the basics of molecular biology and the most important methods applied in this field. The students will aquire basic knowledge how proteins are expressed from genes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, how to work with DNA in the lab (gene technology) and how to produce foreign proteins (e.g. drugs) in cells which are easy to grow in the lab.",

The course will focus on the modeling of stationary bioprocesses, it incudes the formulation of material and energy balances as well as balances on reactive and non-reactive processes and complex plants. The course will also cover the modeling of heat transfer phenomena in heat exchangers and bioreactors. The second course in Bioprocess Modeling and Control provides the students with an in depth understanding of the modeling of biochemical engineering dynamics and the control of bioreactors. Beyond the basic concepts of modeling, process dynamic fundamentals, bioprocess kinetics and the modeling of stagewise processes will be covered. An introduction to modern simulation techniques and software will be given. Students will be enabled to formulate mathematical models and to inplement them into simulation software packages. Some attention will be paid to reactor design for bioprocesses. A particular focus of the course will lie on the design and analysis of modern industrial control strategies for biotechnological processes.",

        "Official Course Description": "Future biotechnologists gain hands-on experience in fundamental techniques of molecular biology and are trained to handle state-of-the-art equipment for bio-process engineering and downstream processing. Starting with an in depth understanding of genetic engineering and laboratory evolution methods, the students follow the path of the gene from cultivation through product formation to product recovery. \nThe first part of the practical lab course includes genetic engineering of microbial DNA (directed evolution) and subsequently introducing the mutated genes into microorganisms via transformation. \nThe second part of the practical course involves cultivation of microorganisms in laboratory scale as well as in production scale (fermentation). Our students will learn methods of concentrating the cell mass and applying different methods to recover a product suitable for subsequent processing (e.g. high pressure homogenizer). The third part of the practical course includes the purification of proteins by chromatography.",

        "Official Course Description": "High throughput screening (HTS) is a tool in the discovery of pharmaceutical, chemical, and agricultural compounds. HTS is a main selective tool in big-scale research programs like drug discovery. Methods of HTS are basically methods of analytical biochemistry (photometry, purification, electrophoresis, kinetic assay, radioisotopes, immunoassay, descriptive statistics, regression analysis, etc), that is why HTS course explicitly covers these subjects, because firm knowledge of methods of analytical biochemistry is crucially important for assay design, its validation, and following data analysis and decision making. During the course we also will learn principles of the various detection techniques (light absorption, fluorescence, readioisotope technique). Consequently, the pivot part of the HTS is assay design, where detection techniques are one of the essential parts, and following statistical treatment of the results will lead to making of the decision. Also we will learn physical principles and operational basics of many analytical biochemical instruments used for multi-sample analysis (microplate readers, scintillation counters) as well as consumables for the HTS. In this course we will cover state of the art technologies including automated liquid handling machines (robots) and techniques used in HTS. A focus will be on genetic engineering techniques and screening systems involved. Additionally required automation and engineering approaches will be covered in detail. The goal is to \nprovide students with a background that enables them to successfully implement HTS strategies in real world applications of high-tech industry by mining the created diversity and finding the needle in haystack.",

It is an integrated part of the lab rotations each student has to attend during the 3rd year education. Two lab rotations per each semester of the 3rd year will give the students the opportunity to visit two to four different research laboratories of the various life sciences disciplines participating in this course structure. All individual lab rotations will finally be written up in a thesis to prove the students ability of performing independent research. Scheduling has to be decided between students and the individual instructor of the particular lab rotations.",

        "Official Course Description": "Environmental Biotechnology is also known as Grey Biotechnology. It is the fundamental basis of applied biotechnology when it is applied to and used to study processes in the natural environment. Environmental Biotechnology could also imply that one try to harness biological process for commercial uses and exploitation. The growing concern over the quality of our environment demands prevention of polluting releases in the ecosystem and treatment of pollutants already there. The lecture course will deal with aerobic and anaerobic treatment of waste water. The most important part a waste-water cleaning plant is the biological part. During several hours of stay a considerable part of the pollution is removed by bacteria and the BOD5 (biological oxygen demand) is reduced by 85 to 95% during the waste-water treatment. Modern waste-water treatment plants do a good job for the removal of the organic matter. The problem nowadays is the removal of nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate) and phosphate from waste-water. The essential processes are nitrification (i.e. oxidation of ammonia to nitrate) and denitrification (i.e. the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen). These processes cannot proceed at the same time or in the same place because nitrification needs high oxygen concentration (oxygen concentration above 2mg/l) whereas denitrification needs anaerobic condition (oxygen concentration lower than 0.1 mg/l). All the different aerobic and anaerobic biological processes that are involved in the elimination of organic pollution from waste water and soil will be discussed in the course.",

This course introduces current theoretical and experimental tools to quantify such interaction between biomolecules. We begin with a molecular view to introduce the relevant forces and interaction necessary to understand and perform molecular modeling. In a second part we follow a more macroscopic thermodynamic view: substrate binding or partitioning, cooperative effects, transport across membranes to name a few keywords. The third part is devoted to kinetic phenomena and the necessary experimental techniques as relaxation theory, correlation spectroscopy, stopped flow.",

Emphasis is on the evaluation of the quality and novelty of the data, the stringency of the conclusions, and the contributions of the findings to the knowledge in the field. New avenues for research are discussed. Presentations of research from the Hammann group may be added as appropriate. \nThe courses are suitable for graduate students in the MoLife MSc program who have strong background in biochemistry and-or molecular genetics (e.g. those in the specialization area Molecular Genetics) and also for final year undergraduates from the BCCB major. \nThe students who attend the courses present papers, possibly several times during the semester, upon which grading is based. Individual presentation training is provided. \nThe two courses take place in alternating semesters, LCRB I in the fall and LCRB II in the spring. Both courses can be taken independently or in addition to one another. No course is a prerequisite for the other, since the literature sources discussed in the two courses are independent of each other.",

        "Official Course Description": "The aim of cell biology is to explain life from molecules through cells to tissues and organisms. Millions of cells and numerous cell types are necessary to maintain the physiology of complex organisms such as a mouse or a human being. Hence eukaryotic cells are diverse in structure and function. This course tends to reach a better understanding on how eukaryotic cells interact with each other in order to form tissues that make up organs such as e.g. the heart, intestine, kidney, liver or the thyroid gland. The focus of the course will be on cellular differentiation to distinct types of cells and their integration into certain organs thereby enabling and maintaining life of an organism. As the course deals with physiology of eukaryotic cells, we will also have to include pathophysiology by discussing common and rare diseases afflicting our body's organs and cells. \nThe course will be held in an interactive lecture style with active participation of the Students. The course material will comprise a selection of textbooks, review articles and original research papers dealing with cells and their function in tissues and organs. Students will contribute by presenting research papers of their own choice or following the suggestions of the Instructor. Student presentations will be included into the respective lecture topics as talks or posters. In depth discussions of specific topics is expected from this as well as related courses in this specialization area (see Handbook for a comprehensive list of our offers). Therefore, the course invites participation of Students who already gained knowledge in the fields of Molecular Cell Biology and/or Molecular Medicine.",

Emphasis is on the evaluation of the quality and novelty of the data, the stringency of the conclusions, and the contributions of the findings to the knowledge in the field. New avenues for research are discussed. Presentations of research from the Springer Group may be added as appropriate. \n \nThe course is suitable for graduate students in MoLife who have a strong background in biochemistry and/or cell biology (i.e. those in the specialization area Cellular and Molecular Biology) but also for undergraduates from the BCCB major. In addition to lectures by the instructor, the students who attend the course present papers, possibly several times during the semester, upon which grading is based. Individual presentation training is provided.",

        "Additional Information": "The course is designed to provide detailed information on how various microbial cells can be engineered for production of valuable bioactive molecules. These molecules include metabolites and proteins relevant as pharmaceuticals and for healthcare or as precursors of such compounds. The basic knowledge of recombinant DNA technology is extended to the state-of-the-art strategies and tools for the engineering of appropriate production organisms. Discussions about chemical, economic and political reasons for biotechnological production of the relevant bioactive molecules are included. As microbial engineering usually includes several rounds of genetic engineering and analysis, the course provides knowledge concerning global analysis approaches (omics technologies: genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, fluxomics) in addition to cutting edge technologies for microbial strain engineering. Topics, such as evolutionary engineering, next generation sequencing and genomic mapping will also be included.",

Starting from the level of a single operon (i.e. a sequence of genes under joint regulation) and ending with large-scale transcriptional regulatory networks we will discuss (and describe with mathematical models) how genes regulate other genes. \nUsing the mathematical models, we will try to connect different levels of dynamical behavior in gene regulation with laboratory data. \nTopics include: recent models of the lac operon; noise in gene expression; statistical properties, evolution and interference of gene regulatory networks; role of DNA topology; robustness of gene regulation; modeling of RNA interference. \nThe material will mostly be recent scientific literature. Grading will be based on seminar presentations and on active participation in the discussions.",

In addition, students will also gain practical knowledge by means of two business games. The Presto business game will help students understand how important the organization of production processes is. Furthermore, the Beer Game (a computer based business game) will address the bullwhip effect in supply chains and improve students\u0092 understanding of logistics and supply chain management. Finally, an excursion to a logistics company in Bremen will be offered within one lab session in order to show how logistics works in the industry world.",

        "Official Course Description": "Project Management contains the application of appropriate knowledge, processes, skills, tools and techniques to contribute to the success of temporary endeavors undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. Project Management is of overwhelming relevance for global economies, esp. those who develop rapidly by innovative processes. Projects could be undertaken at all organizational levels, i.e. involving single persons, a single as well as multiple organizational units and it is relevant to all kinds of industries such as especially logistics that focuses on quantitative, qualitative, spatial and time-related aspects itself. For Logistics, one on the winners of global dynamics, project management also creates the framework for organizational flexibility and ability to adapt to change. In research and practice, project management is of increasing importance and correspondingly accepted to balance the competing project constraints of scope, quality, schedule, budget, resources and risk. (PROJECT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE (2008)). On the individual level, project management knowledge can be considered to be one of the basic skills today. \n \nAim of the Course: \nIn this course, students will learn the theoretical, strategic and practical aspects of international project management on a highly standardized level. The transfer will be guaranteed by sequentally writing a project handbook following a process model including methods and tools for project leaders. \n \nLearning Outcome: \nStudents will \u00eddentify the relevance of international standardized project managament, the different steps to implement, plan, steer and finish a project, to manage esp. risks and opportunities, identify the relevance and influence of stakeholders and environmental and the importance of continuos tracking and learning. Since project management is always team work, students will also form teams and evaluate the success factors of horizontal cooperation. \n \nCurriculum: \n1. Project and Project Management (basic definitions) \n2. Management by Projects \n3. Strategic aspects of multi project management (portfolios) \n4. Managing a project along the lifecycle (process modell IDPSC) \n \nStudents will be asked to transfer the main methods by choosing a transfer project and write a handbook in teams up to 4 participants. The output should not exceed 30 pages (teamwork). There will be an oral exam as second part of the examination.",

        "Official Course Description": "Course objectives - Overview \nAn executive career in the international logistics industry requires excellent communication skills. Managers have to communicate effectively with a large variety of target audiences, in different languages, addressing people in very different professional roles: may they be technical, marketing or management focused. The ability to present and communicate in a concise and confident, yet culturally aware, manner and to build rapport and trust with different audiences is therefore crucial. In this interactive course, students will be introduced to the fundamentals of effective presentation and communication techniques. They will learn how to present themselves, their business, sector or work project with impact, tailoring both the content and their delivery style to different types of audiences. Participants will work individually and in groups on exercises and assignments, receiving feedback from the lecturer as well as peer-to-peer. With the aid of a camera as a fast track training tool, presentations and role plays will be filmed, reviewed and analyzed, and interactive learning documented throughout the course. \n \nLearning Outcomes \n\u0095 Professional competences: enable students to communicate and present professionally in a relevant and concise manner, effectively addressing different types of audiences \n\u0095 Personal competences: ability to build rapport and trust with a variety of target audiences as a prerequisite for leadership \n\u0095 Methodological competences: ability to transfer learned communication skills and techniques to different environments \n\u0095 Practical competences: Ability to present any type of professional work succinctly, including course work \n\u0095 Social competences: Ability to enthuse and motivate others, being part of a multinational team \nProposed Content & format \nThe course will be offered in 4-5 interactive modules of ca. 4 hours each and will cover the following content: \n\u0095 Interpersonal communication skills \no Effective communication techniques in complex business situations \no Differences in communication styles and perception \no Building rapport and trust as a prerequisite to leadership. \n\u0095 Presentation & Pitching Skills \no Structuring content and language of presentations, verbal and non-verbal delivery aspects. \no Introduction to different presentation formats, including pecha kucha and other visual styles. \no Pitching as a competitive form of presenting \u0096 essential formats and techniques \n\u0095 Cross-cultural communication: working in & managing cross-cultural teams \no Communicating effectively across different work styles, values and cultural differences. \no Individual and organisational issues in international environments and ways to solve them.",

        "Official Course Description": "The earlier roots of logistics are traced back to the ancient military operations where it was the war preparation and maintenance function. During the past half a century, logistics has emerged from a set of issues discussed within the marketing field to a scientific discipline on its own mainly because of its high relevance to practice. Logistics deals with the economic networks and the related flows of goods, people, money and information. Logistics discipline is of eclectic nature. As a result, logistics requires methods and tools, insights and experiences from multiple disciplines in order to provide a holistic view for the complex problems arising from the real-world. Among the marketing and military science, logistics works together with fields such as economic, computer science, mathematics, psychology, biology and strategic management. \nFor students pursuing a master of science in International Logistics it is crucial to understand the discipline of logistics and its characteristics, as well as its transdisciplinary influences. Therefore, this course aims at introducing the students to logistics as a scientific, academic discipline. In this manner, the course will introduce numerous scientific methods and approaches in general and their applicability for logistics in particular. Moreover, this course focuses on the development of research and writing skills necessary for successfully managing an advanced course of studies in Logistics on one side and contributing to the research discourse of Logistics on the other side. In fact, Scientific Skills are essential not only in the logistics academic world, but in today\u0092s highly complex world where we have to process reliable and well-founded information constantly, therefore, in the professional world. To be able to manage daily business, it is crucial to be informed and to possess the best tools to extract information from a variety of sources. Skills to produce a variety of texts for different academic and professional assignments are of equal importance. \n \nSpecific topics and issues covered include: \n? Academic sources, referencing, in-text quotations, bibliography, Academic English features, avoiding unintentional plagiarism and academic integrity issues; \n? Reading and writing (topic selection, research question formulation, summarizing and result-oriented reporting, scientific structure, norms and vocabulary); \n? Various approaches to research (analytical versus empirical types of theory building approaches, various aspects of research methodologies such as sample size, timeframe, data analysis and data selection, issues related to various methodological approaches); \n? Research in logistics (main topics and their practical relevance, important academic journals and conferences) \n \nThis course is based on lectures, group work, and self-study components. Students will deliver presentations, posters and written assignments and a feedback loop will be in place through individual appointments. Students will be introduced to research resources available at Jacobs University Bremen\u0092s Information Resource Center (IRC) and then asked to search for their own academic materials to prepare presentations, posters and written assignments. Therefore, the key learning of this course includes the scientific skills required to succeed in this master of science degree in Logistics as well as in the professional world, during one\u0092s career. \n \nLearning Outcomes \n\u0095 Be able to logically structure an essay, a presentation or poster \n\u0095 Prepare a bibliography, avoid unintentional plagiarism and get used to the code of academic integrity. \n\u0095 Be able to deal with huge amounts of texts and information in a fast and efficient manner \n\u0095 Getting used to approaches and methods used within research and academia, particularly for logistics and supply chain management \n \nTeaching Methods \nThis course will utilize introductory lectures, guided self-study of texts, presentations, group and class discussion, and \u0096 in particular \u0096 readings.",

        "Official Course Description": "Analysis I and II is one of the fundamental courses in the mathematical education \n(together with Linear Algebra I and II). Its goal is to develop calculus in a rigorous manner and \nin sufficient generality to prepare the student for advanced work in mathematics. At the same \ntime, the content is chosen so that students arrive quickly at central concepts which are used in \nessentially all mathematics courses, and which are needed in the exact sciences. \nThe Analysis sequence begins with a quick review of natural, rational and real numbers \n(which are assumed as known), and introduces the field of complex numbers. The axiom of \ncompleteness distinguishes the real numbers from the rationals and marks the beginning of \nAnalysis. The complex exponential and trigonometric functions are defined. \nMetric spaces are introduced and used to define continuity and convergence in a general \nframework. The Bolzano-Weierstra\u00df and the Heine-Borel theorems are proved. The intermediate \nand maximal value theorems for functions on the real line are discussed as consequences \nof connectedness and compactness on metric spaces. Sequences of functions are discussed, in \nparticular uniform convergence, as well as the continuity, differentiability, integrability of the \nlimit function. \nDifferentiability of functions on the real line is introduced. The mean value theorem and \nTaylor\u0092s theorem is discussed. \nThe Riemann integral in one variable is introduced. The relation between the derivative and \nthe integral, i.e., the fundamental theorem of calculus is proved. \nThis course has no formal prerequisites; incoming students with a strong mathematics background \nare encouraged to take this class in their first semester. However, a familiarity with \nmathematical reasoning and proof (e.g. proof by induction or by contradiction), such as introduced \nin General Mathematics and Computational Science I, is required.",

        "Official Course Description": "Together with Analysis I, this is one of the basic mathematics courses. It \nintroduces vector spaces and linear maps, which play an important role throughout mathematics \nand its applications. \nThe course begins by introducing the concept of a vector space over an arbitrary field (for \nexample, the real or complex numbers) and the concept of linear independence, leading to the \nnotion of \u0093dimension\u0094. We proceed to define linear maps between vector spaces and discuss \nproperties such as nullity and rank. Linear maps can be represented by matrices and we show \nhow matrices can be used to compute ranks and kernels of linear maps or to solve linear systems \nof equations. \nIn order to study some geometric problems and talk about lengths and angles, we introduce \nan additional structure called the inner or scalar product on real vector spaces. Properties \nof Euclidean vector spaces and orthogonal maps are treated, including the Cauchy-Schwarz \ninequality, Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization and orthogonal and unitary groups. \nAn endomorphism is a linear map from a vector space to itself and is represented by a \nsquare matrix. We study the trace and determinant of endomorphisms and matrices and discuss \neigenvalues and eigenvectors. We discuss the question whether a matrix is diagonalizable and \nstate the theorem on Jordan Normal Form which provides a classification of endomorphisms. \nThis course has no formal prerequisites; incoming students with a strong mathematics background \nare encouraged to take this class in their first semester. However, a familiarity with \nmathematical reasoning and proof (e.g. proof by induction or by contradiction), such as introduced \nin General Mathematics and Computational Science I, is required.",

The goal is to \ndevelop an understanding for interesting mathematical questions beyond the standard first and \nsecond year curriculum. Rather than proving all results in full detail, we visit several different \nareas of mathematics, thus illustrating the breadth and beauty of mathematics. \nTopics vary; past instances of this course have included combinatorial game theory, hyperbolic \nand spherical geometries, manifolds, Fourier analysis and wavelets, the Banach-Tarskiparadox, \ndynamical systems and chaos, and others. \nFor students in Mathematics and ACM, this course is designed to be taken at the same time \nas Analysis I and/or . It is open to anyone with interest and some experience in mathematics \n(for others, General Mathematics and Computational Science I is recommended). Instead of a \nfinal exam, students write a term paper on a mathematical subject of their choice and present it \nto the class.",

        "Official Course Description": "The subject of mathematical physics deals with problems of a physical nature within frameworks of mathematical models. Research of this type has not only resulted in a better understanding of physics, but has also led to new, important developments in mathematics. The converse is also true with mathematicians' contributions being more often of a bottom-up nature, i.e., deriving results starting from a mathematical foundation. In the lectures of this course certain of the mathematical foundations of mathematical physics will be presented. They will of course be motivated by problems from physics and applications to physics will be given following the bottom-up principle. \nFor example, the basics of modern symplectic geometry will be presented and as a consequence fundamental results in classical mechanics will be proved. Quantum mechanics will be built on the foundation of the theory of group representations which uses important methods from geometry and analysis. In this context basic tools involving, e. g. tensor calculus and the spectral theory for operators such as Laplacians, will be presented. Guage theories will be discussed from the viewpoint of fiber bundles. Asymptotic analysis in certain interesting geometric and random matrix contexts will lead to results in semiclassical physics. \n \nThe course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students of Mathematics and Physics. The only prerequisite for the course is a background in basic analysis and linear algebra. All concepts and relevant methods will be explained starting from these minimal prerequisites. Certain proofs will be given in complete detail, but often they will be sketched with reference to the literature for details which add little to the conceptual discussion.",

        "Official Course Description": "This course introduces the theory of functions of one complex variable. \nIt centers around the notion of complex differentiability and its various equivalent characterizations. \nUnlike differentiability for real functions, complex differentiability is a very strong \nproperty; for example it implies that the function is differentiable infinitely often and that it is \nrepresented by its Taylor series in a neighborhood of every point in its domain of definition. \nThis results in a very nice and elegant theory that is used in many areas of mathematics. \nTopics include holomorphic functions, Cauchy integral theorem and formula, Liouville\u0092s \ntheorem, fundamental theorem of algebra, isolated singularities and Laurent series, analytic \ncontinuation and monodromy theorem, residue theorem, normal families and Montel\u0092s theorem, \nand the Riemann mapping theorem. \nPossible further topics are elliptic and modular functions, the Riemann zeta function, introduction \nto Riemann surfaces.",

Knowledge of these topics, especially Lebesgue integration, is instrumental \nin many areas, in particular, for stochastic processes, partial differential equations, applied and \nharmonic analysis, and is a prerequisite for the graduate course in Functional Analysis. \nThe course is suitable for undergraduate students who have taken Analysis I/II, and Linear \nAlgebra I; it should also be taken by incoming students of the Graduate Program in the Mathematical \nSciences. Due to the central role of integration in the applied sciences, this course \nprovides an excellent foundation for mathematically advanced students from physics and engineering",

        "Official Course Description": "Guided Research allows study, typically in the form of a research project, in a particular area of specialization that is not offered by regularly scheduled courses. Each participant must find a member of the faculty as a supervisor, and arrange to work with him or her in a small study group or on a one-on-one basis. \n \nGuided research has three major components: Literature study, research project, and seminar presentation. The relative weight of each will vary according to topic area, the level of preparedness of the participant(s), and the number of students in the study group. Possible research tasks include formulating and proving a conjecture, proving a known theorem in a novel way, investigating a mathematical problem by computer experiments, or studying a problem of practical importance using mathematical methods. \n \nThird year students in Mathematics and Computational Science are advised to take two semesters of Guided Research. The Guided Research report in the spring semester will typically be the Bachelor's Thesis which is a graduation requirement for every IUB undergraduate. Note that the Bachelor's Thesis may also be written as part of any other course by arrangement with the respective instructor of record.",

        "Official Course Description": "The courses from the Engineering and Science Mathematics 1 series provide \nthe foundation for all other Engineering and Science Mathematics courses. Taking at least \none of them is mandatory for all Engineering and Science majors. Emphasis is on the use of \nbasic mathematical concepts and methods in the sciences, rather than on detailed proofs of the \nunderlying mathematical theory. \nThe course ESM 1A covers basic differential and integral calculus of functions of one variable. \nIt starts with a brief review of number systems and elementary functions, then introduces \nlimits (for both sequences and functions) and continuity, and finally derivatives and differentiation \nwith applications (tangent problem, error propagation, minima/maxima, zero-finding, \ncurve sketching). A short chapter introduces complex numbers. \nThe second half of the semester is devoted to integration (anti-derivatives and Riemann \nintegral) with applications, and concluded by brief introductions to scalar separable and linear \nfirst-order differential equations, and the convergence of sequences and power series. \nCompared to ESM 1C which covers similar material, this course assumes a rigorous high \nschool preparation in Mathematics and leaves more room for explaining mathematical concepts \n(as needed for the majority of SES majors).",

        "Official Course Description": "The Course ESM1C Calculus and Matrix Algebra covers the standard topics of pre-calculus (numbers, units, transformations, inequalities, elementary functions and their properties and graphs), single variable calculus (sequences and series, limits and continuity, derivates and differential calculus, anti-derivates and Riemann integral, with selected applications) and a brief introduction to matrix-vector calculus. Sufficient time is spent on the acquisition of solid problem solving skills. \n \nESM1C is an entrance Mathematics course for students in the School of Engineering and Science from Life Sciences and Chemistry Majors, students from School of Humanities and Social Sciences, as well as for students with a less rigorous high school preparation in Mathematics (approval by advisor/program coordinator necessary). It serves as a prerequisite for later ESM and more advanced Mathematics courses. It can be complemented by the lab units 110111 NatSciLab Math Symbolic Software or 110112 NatSciLab Math Numerical Software.",

It consists of lectures \nmainly by professors, but also by other faculty, about current areas of research in mathemaical \nsciences, with particular emphasis on research areas of Jacobs faculty. Students get involved in \ndiscussions of all the areas of research; during the course of the semester, they choose at least \nthree topics which they investigate further and which they elaborate into a research report. At \nthe end of the semester, every student presents at least one of these reports. Participation is also \nopen for advanced undergraduates looking for topics for their undergraduate theses, the results \nof which are presented as well.",

        "Official Course Description": "The earth is under unprecedented environmental stress and this course provides students with a basic foundation for understanding the earth system and how it is affected by human behaviour, particularly by resource extraction and energy use. The course content is transdisciplinary and is divided into three modules: \n \n(1) Earth Surface System: The \"Critical Zone\" is the complex near-surface environment in which interactions between rock, soil, water, air and living organisms define the natural habitat and control the availability of live-sustaining resources. In this module, participants will be introduced in a qualitative way to the basic components of and fundamental processes operating in the critical zone. \n \n(2) Human Interaction with the Environment: It will be demonstrated how physical, chemical and biological processes interact in the geological environment and drive the functions of the ecosystem, and how human activities interfere with these natural processes. Anthropogenic changes in the ecosystem at local and global scales will be discussed, with emphasis on the degradation of the atmosphere, freshwater systems, soils, forests, grassland and cropland and the changes of polar and coastal regions. Strategies are proposed for controlling environment degradation from extraction and consumption of Earth resources and for maintaining a healthful and sustainable earth. \n \n(3) Earth, Energy and Sustainability: \"Energy\" is a multi-dimensional topic that provides several vantage points for understanding sustainability issues. Conventional energy is sourced from the earth, which causes environmental degradation, and energy use is the primary cause of greenhouse gases and climate change. Nonetheless, energy is crucial for development. The challenge is sourcing and using it in a sustainable manner. In this module, students will learn about the sustainability movement, climate change and basic energy facts.",

Securing access to low-cost and reliable sources of energy while at the same time maintaining environmental stewardship are among the most pressing challenges of our age. The aim of this course is to introduce students to economic theories and analytical frameworks for analyzing these issues. The course will begin by covering the economics of energy supply, focusing on both renewable and non-renewable energy sources. On the demand side, the course will distinguish between energy use in the residential, industrial and transportation sectors. Finally, the course will address the functioning of energy markets and market design. This will include discussions on the international oil market, the markets for natural gas, developments in the coal market, and the economics of energy-environment interactions. The course will regularly draw on case studies to illustrate the theoretical concepts.",

        "Official Course Description": "This course will present an overview of major ecological concepts from a rather new and unusual perspective: a process-based perspective. The fundamental processes analysed and discussed in this course are chosen according to their relevance to a planet with carbon-based life that persists over geological timescales. Such processes are: energy flow, multiple guilds, ecological tradeoffs and biodiversity, ecological hypercycles, merging of organismal and ecological physiology, carbon sequestration and photosynthesis. Nutrient cycling will be described as an emergent property of these fundamental processes. Fascinating aspects such as the reasons why a biosphere based on a single species with no nutrient cycling is very unlikely to exist or the possibility that feedbacks between organisms and their environment have helped to maintain habitable conditions on Earth will be explored. By studying the fundamental processes governing the ecology of our planet one can gain a deep understanding of its functioning from an Earth system perspective. The ideas and concepts discussed during the course will be formulated in the context of biology, ecosystem services and conservation biology. \nA module (8 academic hours) on computational ecology will be part of this course. \n \nModule on Computational Ecology \nThe module on computational ecology will consist of brief theoretical lectures and specific laboratory exercises to introduce the students to exponential, logistic, and nutrient-limited growth models. Moreover, a simple Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) model will be presented and a number of exercises will be analysed with the students to explore the importance of life on a planet, a \"Daisywork\" model will be introduced. With computer simulations, students will investigate the conditions under which biology regulates fundamental processes on a planet. \nRecommended would be also a computer lab course on some basic programming although a crash-course in the programming language python will be provided with this module.",

Soil development determines the functioning of soils as ecosystem compartments. Following this conceptual model, the course will start with the processes of soil development and the effect of different soil forming factors on soil formation. \nThe distribution of soil units on a global scale will be shown. Then we will educe soil properties and ecological functioning of soils from soil development. Interactions between soils and other ecosystem compartments (hydrosphere, biosphere) will be clarified. Finally the use of soils and human impact on soils will be addressed.",

It is a mandatory course for physics majors but can \nalso serve as a general introduction to physics for all other majors. \nIt is neither the traditional experimental physics lecture, nor a pure theoretical physics \ncourse. Both aspects are combined and special emphasis is laid on general principles, not \non extensive mathematical derivations. Nevertheless, the course teaches calculus based physics \nso that some basic mathematical knowledge will be required. Experiments are integrated into \nthe lectures. \nThe course consists of the following two parts: \n\u000f Mechanics including: motion and coordinate systems; forces and Newton laws; work \nand energy; collisions and momentum; rotations, torque, angular momentum; Kepler \nlaws and gravitation; continuum mechanics and elasticity; fluid mechanics; harmonic \noscillator, damping, resonance; waves. \n\u000f Thermodynamics including: temperature, heat, heat capacity; transport phenomena; ideal \ngas, kinetic gas theory; MB distribution; Brownian motion; 1st law, energy, heat and \nwork; 2nd law, cyclic processes, engines; entropy and statistical interpretation; thermodynamic \npotentials.",

The physics module occupies 8 \nof the 24 afternoon sessions of the first year Natural Science Laboratory Course. For students \nplanning to major in the School of Engineering and Science, participation in the Natural Science \nLab Course is mandatory (lectures and lab course modules have to correspond). For all \nother students wishing to enroll in the physics lab module, attendance of the General Physics \nlecture is co-requisite, since the lab course is taught in close coordination with the lecture. In \nthe physics module, participants carry out 7 experiments in total covering topics of mechanics, \nthermodynamics and optics. Aims of the lab course are: (1) to gain hands on experience of \nthe material taught in General Physics, (2) to learn how scientific experiments are planned, carried \nout, analysed, and reported, (3) learn about technical aspects of measuring and measuring \ndevices.",

The course accompanies the physics lectures and therefore, a close relationship between laboratory and lectures exists during the whole semester. \nParticipants carry out twelve experiments chosen from mechanics and non-linear dynamics, continuum mechanics, electromagnetism and optics. The experiments are more advanced than those offered in the first-year Natural Science Laboratory Course Module in Physics. Skills learned there can now be applied to gain a deeper insight into different aspects of advanced physics, partly already pointing to modern applications.",

        "Official Course Description": "The introductory course on Computer Simulation Methods discusses a number of practical, numerical solutions for typical problems in sciences. While, for example, the very nature of physics is to express relationsships between physical quantities in mathematical terms, an analytic solution of the resulting formulars is often not available. Instead, numerical solutions based on computer programs are required to obtain useful results for real-life problems. During this course different numerical techniques are introduced such as integration, interpolation, root finding, and solving differential equations which are important tools in any numerical approach. These methods will be applied to a selection of problems including the classical dynamics of particles, traffic simulations, simple electrostatics, random processes, etc. Since the course includes numerous examples and exercises for programming codes, some programming skills in C, Fortran or Python are strongly recommended as prerequisites.",

Processes acting on all planetary bodies are reviewed. Strong emphasis is on comparative planetology aspects like evolutionary processes and landforms that are relevant for several planets and satellites, in comparison to those on the Earth. Topics include: solar system formation and general evolution; impact cratering; planetary chronology; interior structure and composition of planetary bodies; planerary atmospheres and climate; planetary sedimentary, tectonic and volcanic processes (including exotic, e.g. cryovolcanism); geologic and geodynamic evolution of rocky planets and satellites.",

        "Official Course Description": "This course is a continuation of the second-year course on a higher level. An overview is given on sedimentological and (bio)geochemical processes that determine the geologic record. The course will first focus on sedimentological processes like erosion, transportation and deposition of particles in estuarine, beach, continental shelf and slope, and deep sea environments. It will lead to a better understanding of basic processes, such as tides, wind stress, topographic effects on turbulence, and exchange flow. The vertical and horizontal mixing and residence times of particles important to biological and geological processes will be discussed. The goal of biogeochemical oceanography is to understand what controls the abundances, kinds, and temporal variations of organisms in the sea, which are related tothe flow of organic matter. Progress toward this goal usually entails identifying the patterns of variability in space and time, determining the processes producing and maintaining the patterns, then quantifying the processes. The path to predictive understanding of biogeochemical processes leads into physical, chemical, or geological oceanography.",

A GRP may focus on experimental work, a field campaign, data analysis, computer simultations, theory, modelling, or a literature review. In order to be as effective as possible within the very limited amount of time, we stronlgy recommend to select one topic for both, the Fall and the Spring semester GRC. \nThe Fall semester GRC may involve a literature review in order to prepare for a project in Spring when a lab, field, data analysis, modelling, or theory project should be carried out. Students who are interested in taking a GRC in Geosciences and Astrophysics are invited to contact the instructors of record for more information on potential project topics. Each GRC must be concluded with a written report which will be graded.",

This course will be taught during the summer break, preferentially in early June or late August (ESS students who plan to take this course are advised to do their required internship between the 2nd and 3rd semester). In the course, students will be made familiar with geological features at various scales and with techniques applied in geological field work.The excursion focuses on geological sequences that illustrate the chemical evolution of the Earths lithosphere, oceans and atmosphere, water chemistry, and (depending on the region visited) the formation of metal deposits and their environmental impact. Hence, open-pit and underground mines are visited if possible. In the past this excursion took students to South Africa or Irland. Students are given the opportunity to acquire water or rock samples for their B.Sc. thesis project during this excursion.",

Based on the \"seven petroleum geological magics\" the development of petroleum systems consisting of source rocks and their maturation, migration of hydrocarbons, deposition of reservoir and seal rocks, the formation of geological traps, and the favorable timing of all these processes will be presented, followed by volumetric reservoir calculations. An overview on the chemistry and physics of oil and gas including the occurrences of conventional and unconventional oil and gas (e.g. gas hydrates and oil sands) and their geopolitical importance will be introduced. The course will be concluded with an overview on different exploration and exploitation methods (e.g. enhanced oil recovery). The lectures will be supplemented by practical exercises.",

The students will be assigned a short research project in a cutting edge field of chemical research. Within the course students will learn under direct supervision of graduate students how to plan, carry out and interpret chemical experiments using modern equipment in the research laboratories of Jacobs University. \nStudents are expected to attend research group meetings of the individual research groups to further their knowledge in a specialised field of chemical research. It is expected that the students work at least one full day a week in the research laboratories. At the end of this course students are expected to summarise their results in a short report and give an oral presentation defending their results in a research group seminar.",

Classical and quantum field theory provides the foundation for much of physics. A thorough knowledge of the theory is indispensable for particle physics and gravitational physics and very helpful for condensed matter - solid state physics and many other fields. The course includes a review of relevant background material in physics and mathematics. \nTopics: Special relativity, point particles and extended objects in background fields, continuum limit and fields, the scalar field, symmetries and conservation laws; gauge symmetry and gauge fields, Maxwell's equations and their solutions, boundary value problems, electromagnetic radiation, electromagnetic fields in media (optics); non-abelian gauge theory, spontaneous symmetry breaking with applications in particle physics and condensed matter theory, general relativity, Einstein's equations and important solutions; applications to the physics of stars, black holes, and cosmology; quantum field theory, canonical quantization, path integrals, Feynman diagrams, renormalization; selection of more advanced topics.

        "Official Course Description": "Ten years ago only transition metal or enzyme mediated enantioselective catalysis were pursued. Organocatalysis is now a third option, providing competitive, as well as complementary, solutions for the synthesis of diastereo- and enantioenriched pharmaceutical drugs and natural products. The underlying premise is that low molecular weight chiral organic molecules can be designed and employed for the catalytic activation of achiral starting materials culminating in asymmetric bond formation. The catalysis concepts originate from Bronsted acid and base chemistry and rely heavily on covalent activation and/or strong chiral counter ion effects. When bifunctional organocatalysts are used, weaker (noncovalent) attractive forces (notably hydrogen bonding) become important. Incorporation of these concepts into small all organic catalysts that fine-tuned with the required steric and electronic features allow chemists to control the trajectory, facial approach, and conformation of reacting chemical partners. Students interested in this course will also feel comfortable with the basics of enzymatic pathways (biochemistry), and the overarching principles noted in the first year of organic chemistry. The course will strengthen and expand on those foundations to allow a clearer picture of the critical stereocontrol elements required for natural product synthesis and by extension pharmaceutical drugs.",

The focus will lie on organic and biological functional systems and on applications in the physical sciences, thus complementing the inorganic, material-related and methodological aspects covered in Nanomolecular Science. It deals with supramolecular chemistry, the construction of nanomolecular functional systems including shuttles, photonic devices, molecular rotors and machines, and molecular containers, including biological examples and applications, e.g. drug delivery and hightroughput screening. Synthetic aspects of supramolecular assemblies, both of discrete monodisperse nature (calixarenes, functionalized fullerenes, cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils), as well as less well defined polydisperse systems like dendrimers will be discussed.",

During two consecutive courses the students are exposed to a specific research area of physics in-depth. For this the student is required to participate in the research activities of a Jacobs University faculty member who participates in the Physical Sciences graduate program. Typically a continuous project defined by the supervising faculty member is conducted during the consecutive Advanced Guided Research courses. The research can involve experimental and-or theoretical topics. Grading for this course is based on lab performance and the quality of research reports. Furthermore, the Advanced Guided Research courses should enable the students for preparing a M.Sc. thesis in the 4th semester or entering the Ph.D. phase.",

        "Official Course Description": "This course introduces to the major experimental and analytical techniques to analyse the structure and activity of molecules. It discusses basic methods commonly used by physicists, chemists, and life scienctists to characterize molecular systems of interest. It starts with a general introduction to basic interactions between atoms and molecules and their environment, needed to understand the working principles of experimental techniques. The main part focusses on the individual experimental technique including X-ray diffraction, NMR, mass spectrometry, optical spectroscopy, microscopy, light scattering, calorimetry and electrochemistry. Some basic concepts from physics and physical chemistry and a certain basic mathematical background are necessary to understand the working principle of the different instruments. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we will discuss the theoretical background and application of the different methods, complemented by visits of Jacobs research labs using those analytical instruments. \nThe course serves as an introductory course to analytical techniques for MSc students. It can also serve as a specialization for 3rd year undergraduate students in physics, chemistry, or other majors interested in an overview of modern experimental techniques in physical chemistry, biophysics, analytical chemistry or mateial science.",

Securing access to low-cost and reliable sources of energy while at the same time maintaining environmental stewardship are among the most pressing challenges of our age. The aim of this course is to introduce students to economic theories and analytical frameworks for analyzing these issues. The course will begin by covering the economics of energy supply, focusing on both renewable and non-renewable energy sources. On the demand side, the course will distinguish between energy use in the residential, industrial and transportation sectors. Finally, the course will address the functioning of energy markets and market design. This will include discussions on the international oil market, the markets for natural gas, developments in the coal market, and the economics of energy-environment interactions. The course will regularly draw on case studies to illustrate the theoretical concepts.",

This course introduces students to fundamental ideas on why organizations exist, how people behave in organizations, how organizations can be designed and changed strategically, and how they evolve in their environments. Managers also need to build and maintain inter-organizational relationships in projects, alliances, networks, supply chains and partnerships with various other organizations and in increasingly international contexts. The course covers classical principles of the division and integration of labor within and across firms. It also fosters a critical perspective on organizing as an ongoing creative, collective and contested practice that entails limitations for managerial control. Through project work, students learn what it means to be part of, and responsible for, contemporary organizations.",

It links the study of political and social movements trying to reform society and politics by way of transnational co-operation with the process of internationalizing cultural, political, and economic practices. The historical perspective recognizes the increasing, yet ambivalent transnational linking of societies. The tension between globalization and fragmentation can be studied in various areas, including the environment, consumer culture, peace movements, governmental organizations, and transnational corporations. The development started in Europe but soon encompassed the rest of the globe. The course provides students with a critical understanding of the making of today's international world.",

Depending on the academic specialization of the professor, the focus can be on one region. Emphasis is being put on the connections, but also the demarcations within regions as well as their position within a global system of exchanges and power. The lecture combines a discussion of major developments with problems of Asian approaches to history. Major themes include but are not restricted to: the development of nationalisms and states; a discussion of colonialism and imperialism; problems of peace and war; identities; selected issues of social and cultural history (such as the role of religion in culture and society, ethnic relations; gender relations, etc.).",

        "Official Course Description": "North America, and the United States in particular, has developed a particular society and identity which sets it apart from both Europe and other non-European cultures (such as Asia, Africa). The origins of North American society in a mixture of indigenous, European, and African influences at the same time provides an excellent paradigm for analyzing problems of cultural identity, of settler societies and post-colonial legacies, and of today's \"multiculturalism\". At the same time, the United States, as the only remaining \"super-power\" in the 21st century and as the leader in defining the world's popular culture, has an impact on the past and present of all other world region's that needs to be explained and understood. A third rationale for this course is the American model of education around which IUB is built; hence, a deeper understanding of American culture is expected to be part of the history students' education. - As a lecture, this course provides an overview of North American history from pre-Columbian beginnings to the late twentieth century. Students will be introduced to the major themes and problems in British colonial America, and in the national history of the United States; at the same time, they learn about interpretations and historiographical concepts relating to American history (e.g., \"American exceptionalism\"). Besides providing the students with this basic knowledge and understanding, the course may approach American history with an emphasis on a particular problem or perspective (e.g., \"democracy\", \"race relations and multicultural society\", \"America in the world\").",

As many topics in modern European history are addressed more extensively in more specific courses in modules II to IV, and since some of this history is familiar to most students from their high school history courses, the objective of this lecture is an introduction to a historical understanding and interpretation of major processes in those two centuries, and the emphasis therefore is rather on historical concepts and interpretations than on summarizing facts and events. As part of the World Regions and Civilizations module, the course will also try to sensitize students to the particular identity of a common European history, as opposed to the recent history of other world regions. On the other hand, students will learn about the diversity of European cultures and the most important \"sub-regions\" of modern European history. Topics include the transformation of Ancien R\u00e9gimes and revolutionary change; the emergence of industrial societies and economies; the formation of nation-states and empire-building, modern political ideologies such as liberalism, nationalism, or socialism; war, dictatorship and the European dimensions of the Holocaust; post-war prosperity and environmental changes.",

        "Official Course Description": "The notion of world religions was coined at the end of the 19th century and refers to religions that are spreading independently of territory, language, and nation. Religions of this type emerged, when prophets rejected given social norms and propagated new values. Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism established a split between an existing social reality and a sacred and just order. The religious institutions of temple and synagogue, of church and sects, of mosques, orders, and temples preserved and transmitted that message; a corpus of sacred texts became the source for practical attitudes to the world; a class of learned authorities was responsible for their interpretation. \nThis legacy shaped these religions in the modern age. Constitutive to a modern culture is an interior rift. While the present age is seen as superior to past and foreign cultures with regard to technology and science, past and foreign cultures are acknowledged as preserving a value of their own. When philosophers in the age of Enlightenment levelled profound criticism against any trust in transmitted truth claims and favoured their replacement by a reasonable religion, they met opposition by other intellectuals who saw in the history of religions a manifestation of a power uncontrollable by human reason, but part of human existence. \nThe Biblical account of the redemption of Israel from the bondage in Egypt became a powerful metaphor for an enduring longing for redemption and for practical experiments with truth. New meanings of history and of nature were retrieved from the tradition that contradict secular beliefs in progress and rationality (Apocalypticism; Esotericism). In Judaism Messianism, Kabbalah, and Hasidism established forms of religiosity that had an impact on the culture and politics of modern Israel. Christianity developed out of Jewish Messianism and taught from its very beginning diverse paths of redemption from an irrational world. Islam emerged as a religion of a sacred community dedicated to common ritual practices and mutual solidarity. When the transmitted Islamic order collapsed under the impact of Western colonialism, new leaders emerged and turned a habitus of quietism into an active subjective religiosity e.g. Islamism, Jihadism, Salafism. Western colonialism likewise challenged Hinduism that became a religion of its own only in the 19th century, though its heritage derived from earliest times. Typical to modern Hinduism are the Bhagavad-Gita and Mohandas Ghandi\u0092s practice of non-violent resistance against Colonialism. These new forms of religiosity derive their persuasive power from their ability to define the situation of human beings in the modern world.",

        "Official Course Description": "After imperialism and colonialism, capitalism has transcended the system of the national states and cultures by generating a globalized economical and cultural world. The dynamics of globalization and migration creates multicultural and multilingual situations with specific tensions, problems and chances. Especially the national states with their monocultural and monolingual traditions face radically new social challenges which are discussed in theories of multiculturalism. Tensions arise between the old national languages (and the traditional regional languages), the languages of the immigrants and the new global language English: What language shall be used in public education, what shall be the position of the languages of the migrants in the public life of the states? What is the role of global English in these transformations? Is the spread of global English a case of linguistic imperialism, is it responsible for the death of languages, does it create a new aristocracy in the European countries? How does the European Union deal with the plurality of its languages? The course sheds light on these processes and tensions as mirrored in literature. It examines how multilingual authors have become a constitutive part of the literary scene, thus reshaping the concept and scope of literature, and in which way the regional and culturally homogenous mode of literary production is challenged by a global type of discourse and practice.",

Familiarity with modern and global contemporary concepts of world art history \n? Visual analysis of a diverse range of world art \n? Critical discussion of various issues facing world art today \n? Competence in scholarly debate and writing \n? Grading based on active participation, reading assignments, a topical presentation, and a research paper. \n \n \n \nContent: \n \nThis course introduces into the study of world art and art history. It combines an object-led approach with a theoretical art-historical perspective in order to explain by which parameters art is constituted as \u0093world art\u0094, how it (in)forms world art history as both history and study field of world art, and why it matters to preserve the world-artistic heritage. Drawing on art history, anthropology, material culture and cultural heritage studies, and examining case studies from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania, it takes a critical look at the different approaches to the world\u0092s artistic heritage, its production and reception. It explores how world art has been collected, traded, and displayed, and addresses the economic and political interests that have long imposed conflicting aesthetic agendas on the artefacts in question. Furthermore, the course investigates some of the challenges faced by world art today and provides insight into new interdisciplinary conceptualizations of world art studies which involve a broad range of disciplines from the natural sciences and engineering to the cultural and political sciences. A museum visit will form an integral part of the course.",

        "Official Course Description": "History is the playing out of a few key ideas. The 'Axial Age' thinkers actually reflected on these key ideas. So we have 'love', 'faith', 'ren' (benevolence), 'yi' (justice) for dealing with interpersonal relationships, we have 'Heaven' and 'Dao' (Way) for dealing with human-nature relationships and defining who we are and how we should conduct ourselves, we have 'fa' (law) and 'xing' (penalty) to punish and regulate. That\u0092s why these have been influential, even up until today. Now, in our age of globalization, there\u0092s more need for us to review and to rethink these fundamental key ideas, as actually expressed by those thinkers, in this case the seven seminal Chinese thinkers, namely, Kongzi (Confucius), Mozi, Mengzi (Mencius), Laozi, Zhuangzi, Xunzi, and Han Feizi. So this course is intended as a mirror for those from other cultures to relativize themselves so as to arrive at 'New Axial Age' formulations through cross-cultural dialogues and mutual appreciation. But do not be intimidated by this grandiose aim: we go basically with one book, and only some parts of their most important writings. And we learn and enjoy.",

As an alternative to this Adorno outlined his Aesthetic Theory, made concrete in his essays on music and on literature. \nInstruction focuses on the theoretical potential of this tradition by discussing theoretical texts from its founding period and its later evolution. The course aims to give students an understanding of the usefulness of philosophical aesthetics and of its applicability to actual problems in Literary and Cultural Studies. \n \n Teaching credits (non-public):\n 1",

        "Official Course Description": "This course deals with the main subjects of present day international public law, first the theoretical foundations of international law and its practical importance. It stresses the differences between the main sources of international law (article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice), always in relations to judgements of international courts, national courts or even arbitral awards. It discusses the general principles of international law in relations to the North Sea Continental Shelf Case (Federal Republic of Germany vs. Denmark and the Netherlands) and the case of the diversion of water from the river Meuse (Netherlands vs. Belgium). The relations between international law and municipal law give rise to questions according to cases of the European Court of Human Rights and of the German Federal Constitutional Court. The subjects of international law are discussed focusing on the qualification of States as a subject of International Law according to the Montevideo Convention and on recent questions like that of failed States (e.g. Somalia) or on situations near to secession (e.g. Kosovo, Transnistria, Ossetia etc.) The principle of self-determination in the UN-Charta has played a major role in the formation of newly independent States and has influenced the development of the rules on state-succession. Beside States, international organizations and recently the individual are playing a more and more prominent role as subjects of international law. How can the position of the individual as a subject of international law be justified and what is its status in the field of human rights? \n \nThe course focuses also on territory as an important element of the notion of State besides the population and state authority and sovereignty. Transfer of territory is as well discussed as the importance of discovery as a title to territory. Another chapter of the course deals with land boundaries and other boundaries and the extent of state jurisdiction (the Lotus-case and the case concerning the arrest warrant by a Belgium judge for the congolese foreign minister (Democratic Republic of Congo vs. Belgium). State immunity has undergone a very rapid recent development which is explained in relation to quite a number of cases. \n \nAnother chapter deals with the law of the sea and of state responsibility, the treatment of aliens and the protection of property, the law of treaties and the development of human rights. A chapter of the course is devoted to the use of force by States, the problem of intervention and the limitations of self-defence. The concluding chapter deals with judicial control and protection by international and national courts and makes the students familiar with the techniques of legal argumentation.",

It is not the intention of the course to introduce the participants to the law of Germany, Europe or any other specific part of the world. The course will explore general principles of law; principles that are common to many (or most) legal traditions. \n \nThe course covers questions around the definitions and sources of law; analyses the distinction between the various branches of law (e.g. constitutional law, criminal law, private law, public and private international law) and their principal characteristics; asks about the different legal traditions of the world; studies the concepts of legal interpretation; and gives an introduction to the internationalisation of law and efforts to harmonise in particular the law of commerce. The question of law and justice will be dealt with in the last part of the course by referring to the principle of constitutionalism, international human rights law and selected approaches in modern jurisprudence.",

Not only have the international legal rules embedded in international institutions such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the International Labour Organization and the European Union become more and more precise; the web of international legal rules has itself also become increasingly dense. Today these international rules define the rights (and duties) not only of states but also of social groups and individuals. In addition, these international rules are increasingly embedded in an institutionalized infrastructure in which legislation (rule-setting), adjudication (rule-application) and enforcement (rule-implementation) follow fundamental principles of due process. The course will consider the prospects and limitations (and even setbacks) of these transformations - i.e. legalization - while at the same time examining their causes and consequences.",

        "Official Course Description": "Cognitive scientists and cultural theorists traditionally have thought about the culture's influences on cognition quite differently. From a Cognitive Science perspective, the study of cognition typically is construed as the search for those aspects of mental experience that are uniformly true for all. In fact for much of the 20th century most psychologists assumed that all normal human beings were equipped with the same set of attentional, perceptual, memorial, learning, and inferential procedures. From a Cultural Studies perspective, there is no avoiding the cultural framework within which individuals think and act. The idea of universal mental experiences is often rejected outright by many cultural theorists; every human thought and perception is uniquely situated within a very specific framework informed by history, tradition, language, social context, etc. The goal of this seminar is to explore the dynamic of both perspectives by asking which aspects of human thinking and judgment are universally the same or culturally shaped. \nIn particular the following issues and questions will be addressed: \n \n- Definitions of culture and dimensions of cultural comparisons \n- Methodological challenges of studying culture's influences \n- Culture and systems of thought: Analytic versus holistic thinking \n- Causal attribution across cultures: How fundamental is the fundamental attribution error? \n- Cultural differences in reasoning: Western logic versus Eastern dialectics \n- The self-concept in a cross-cultural perspective: Independent versus interdependent self-construals \n- Culture and context: How flexible are cross-cultural variations in self-construals? \n- Does thinking about the self influence thinking in general? \n- Direct versus indirect communication in different cultures \n- Characteristics of cross-cultural interaction: Working in multi-cultural teams \n- Intercultural trainings \n \nThis seminar provides an introduction to important theoretical approaches from both Cognitive and Social Psychology as well as from adjacent other disciplines, like Anthropology or Ethnology. The discussed research findings may, however, help to improve cross-cultural interaction in many applied fields.",

        "Official Course Description": "Social Psychology is a scientific field that seeks to understand the nature and causes of individual behaviour, thought, judgment and emotion in social situations. In other words, our feelings, thoughts and behaviour are very much influenced by typical contextual factors such as the living environment, the social structure, or the political sphere, to name a few. However, context also refers to other factors that influence how an object or a person is perceived, such as the mood, the expectations, the needs and the prior knowledge of a perceiver. Other Social Psychology issues of interest include how people interact, how inter-group conflict can be understood, and when people help each other or aggress against each other. \nThis lecture will review important aspects of social psychological research, which then will be discussed in more detail in 2nd and 3rd year seminars. These aspects include: \n \n- History of Social Psychology: A brief history of the origins of Psychology and the development of Social Psychology as an own discipline. \n- Basic concepts and methods of Social Psychology \n- Classic theories: Attribution theory, dissonance theory, and self perception theory, etc. \n- Person perception and social encoding: Which features are salient and which drive our evaluation? What affects our attitudes and our evaluation of people? \n- Person memory: Which information is remembered? \n- Stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination: The concept of stereotypes and their consequences. How can stereotypes be changed? \n- Social inference: How do judgments and decisions change according to the social contexts? Heuristics and biases. Bad and good decision-making. \n- Automatic social cognition: Basic concepts, theories, and experiments on the ongoing consciousness debate. Are all our judgments malleable? Is most of our behaviour produced unintentionally? \n- Inter-group conflict and behaviour: How can inter-group conflict be understood and resolved? What produces it? How can it be prevented? \n- Social Identity and the self: How can the self be understood from a social psychological perspective? \n- Communication: Theories of communication. Group work and group performance. Communication problems. \n- Mood: Social Psychological theories of mood. The influences of mood on cognition. The influence of cognition on mood. Mood and behaviour. \n- Motivation: Theories of needs and goals. Behaviour in the social context. Achievement motivation. Aggression and pro-social behaviour.",

        "Official Course Description": "Generally speaking, this course is about how individuals think and feel about members of other social categories (e.g. defined in terms of race or ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, weight, age group, disabilities etc.) and how they behave in relation to them - in other words, about the phenomena that have been termed \"stereotypes\", \"prejudice\", and \"discrimination\". These complex social psychological phenomena involve basic cognitive and affective processes in individuals as much as processes related to group norms, intergroup relations, and social construction in a given socio-cultural context. \nThe course covers the conceptualization and measurement of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination and, with consideration of multiple levels of analysis, their various sources as well as approaches to combating them. More specifically, the topics covered in the course include: \n \n-Prevalence of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination in society (e.g. at the workplace, in education); cultural differences \n-The target's perspective: consequences of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. stereotype threat, self-fulfilling prophecy) \n-History of research on stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination \n-Research methods and measurement of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. implicit and explicit measures, old-fashioned and modern racism/sexism) \n-Levels of analysis and different theoretical approaches (e.g. social cognition, social norms and identities, inter-group conflict) \n-The mental representation of stereotypes: person memory (schema, prototype, exemplar models), models of stereotype change \n-Cognitive and affective factors involved in stereotype activation and application (e.g. social categorization, automaticity, mood, motivation, self-esteem) \n-Individual differences in stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. personality, authoritarianism, social dominance orientation) \n-Social identity: the role of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination for group identity \n-Intergroup relations: how stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination depend on the relations between groups in society (e.g. competition for resources, intergroup threats) \n-Strategies to combat stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (stereotype suppression, contact hypothesis, Jigsaw classrooms, political correctness norms, collective action, societal and legal changes.)",

In addition, there will be individual meetings with the groups linked to their specific projects. An emphasis is put on the translation of prescientific observations to clear hypotheses and their link to existing theoretical frameworks. Critical analysis and discussion of these elements are of particular importance. \nThe results of the studies are to be presented in the form of simulated conference presentations or posters.",

        "Official Course Description": "Starting from the observation that all economic activity is embedded in social relations, this lecture studies economic phenomena as interwined with social and political processes by enriching a strict economic understanding of markets and economic life by bringing in dimensions of power, social inequality, status and domination. At the micro level we study the interaction between utility-maximization and other motivational factors, such as norms, values and emotions. At the macro level we study the role of political institutions as well as the role of culture and religion in economic life. One of the key challenges addressed is how to combine economic prosperity with sustainable social and environmental development.",

        "Official Course Description": "In the early 1970s, planning experts Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber coined the term \"wicked\" as a label for the most difficult type of problems facing decision -makers. They argued that much harm has come from continuous attempts to resolve the wicked problems that abound in today's complex societies with methods that are only appropriate for simple (or \"tame\") issues. In this course, you learn to distinguish wicked from tame environmental problems, and gain insight into the policies and institutions with which wicked environmental issues can be successfully resolved. In the process, you come to understand the alternative views of time, space, risk, nature, human nature, technology and democracy that stakeholders in debates about wicked environmental problems believe in. You are also introduced to a leading social theory with which to better understand these issues. Examples of wicked environmental problems that we look at include climate change, loss of biodiversity, Himalayan deforestation as well as the polution of the Rhine river and the Great Lakes.",

In this course, students will gain a theoretical and practical understanding of why states create international organizations (IOs) and the challenges of global governance. We will examine the historical origins, functions, effectiveness of and controversies surrounding several international organizations, including the United Nations (UN), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the International Energy Agency (IEA). Upon completion of the course, students should be able to think critically about both the nature of the problems facing states today and how states respond.",

        "Official Course Description": "Culture is an important source of both, social integration and disintegration. On the one hand, it provides unified symbolic frames and shared normative and cognitive understandings. On the other hand, its production is a highly contested terrain, prone to change and innovation. This seminar looks at culture from both angles. It examines the dynamics of symbolic and objectified meaning production, and analyses how culture affects, and is in turn affected by, social conditions and political institutions.",

        "Official Course Description": "During the Cold War, issues of international security were determining the international political scene. The risk of major international crises if not outright war determined strategic thinking and behavior. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it appeared that humanitarian intervention rather than military security was becoming the new paradigm. After September 2001, however, more aggressive conceptions of international security have again come to the fore. The goal of this course is to introduce major empirical issues about international security in a theoretically informed way. \nThe course therefore requires both a strong interest in theory and a willingness to engage in some research about the historical evidence. Students will have the opportunity to combine the theoretical and empirical knowledge acquired during the course in a series of working group sessions, joint presentations, and in their homework.",

        "Official Course Description": "This course deals with the ethical dimension of international politics in general and of modes of international governance in particular. In the first part of the course participants are introduced to moral philosophy, with a special emphasis on problems of social justice. The second part considers representatives of the most important schools of thought in international ethics, commonly referred to as moral skeptics, communitarians (or statists), and cosmopolitans, and examines their ideas. Subsequently, the course focuses its attention on a range of more specific problems, each viewed from a normative perspective: the ethics of force and coercion (including intervention) in international politics; the nature, scope, and justifiability of distributive justice at the international and transnational levels (including the problem of intergenerational justice that comes into play in such issues as climate change); and the moral requirements of the global polity (including the problem of the world-state). Finally, the course looks at the possibilities of, and constraints on, transboundary ethical behavior and addresses the question of whether there is such a thing as moral progress at the international level.",

It introduces basic analytical concepts such as actors, different types of institutions, and forms of cooperation. Special emphasis is given to the field of international relations. The course deals with the conceptualization of actors and different types of actor constellations, basic institutional settings, and the role of interaction orientations. Guiding questions are: How can we explain cooperation and cooperation failure? \nWhat is the role of institutions in cooperation and cooperation failure? How do we account for institutional change? Throughout the course, the theoretical issues are illustrated with empirical examples.",

We will look at the various levels at which comparisons can be conducted, i.e. comparisons at the individual and at the group level. The major focus of the course will be on exploring important variables in comparative research, such as gender, age, race, society, culture, ethnicity, nationality, media systems, historicity, etc., and special methodological concerns that arise from taking these factors into account. \n \nThe course will be held in two sessions of 75 minutes each. The first session each week will serve as an introduction to relevant methodological aspects. During the second session, we will look at pertinent research examples and discuss the methodological problems raised by the respective research question and how the researchers set about solving them.",

The focus of the seminar is on learning about and discussing methodological principles and rules whose purpose it is to help us plan, structure, and organize our research endeavors in ways that maximize the probability of achieving valid and relevant results, particularly in the area of \u0093theory-oriented research\u0094 (where \u0093theory\u0094 almost exclusively refers to \u0093positive\u0094 rather than \u0093normative\u0094 theory). It deals with questions such as the following: What are the features of a good research design? Which research questions are worth studying? What is a theory? How can we build and test theories? What is a scientific explanation? In addition, the seminar looks at some problems of the philosophy of social science, e.g. by reviewing the debate between \u0093naturalists\u0094 (who argue that social science is about explaining collective human behavior in a scientific manner) and \u0093interpretivists\u0094 (who argue that social life can only be understood from within).",

        "Official Course Description": "The course covers the main approaches, methods for data collection and data analysis used in qualitative research. Although the philosophy underlying qualitative research will be touched upon, the focus will be less on methodological issues and more on actual research practice, enabling the students to conduct their own qualitative research. \n \nThe first part (weeks 1 through 7) will start out with a recap of qualitative research. The recap will be followed by sessions on case selection, qualitative research design and data collection. Course participants will then work on the design and data collection phase of their own individual research. \n \nIn the second part (weeks 8 through 14), methods for data analysis (such as coding, content analysis, or discourse analysis) and mixed methods research will be covered. The course will conclude with a session in which students present their individual research projects.",
