Students will learn about inter- and intraindividual differences in biological, psychological, and social aging, how adaptive competencies and learning abilities develop over the lifespan and how adaptation to internal and external factors allows healthy and successful aging. Also different types of interventions for enabling successful aging will be discussed. We will always focus on neurobiological and behavior results as well as on the development of brain and body.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N354295587281746,-N354295587268747,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

There are strong indications from various disciplines \u0096 philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, biology, neuroscience, media and communication, art history as well as applied therapy and visual design that there is an intrinsic connection between the sense of seeing/vision, and an empathetic or apathetic reaction to these visuals.

Low dimensional autonomous dynamical systems: formulation as differential equation, \nflow, fixed points, stability, stability criteria, potentials and Lyapunov functionals, simple local \nbifurcations (saddle-node, pitchfork, transcritical, cusp, Hopf), simple numerical schemes, \ntime-discrete maps (fixed points, stability), introduction to chaos. \n2. Control for linear systems: general matrix-based solution for driven linear ODEs, reachability, \ncontrollability, observability, Gram-matrix for determining control laws and for reconstruction, \nlinear-state feedback controller, stable-state estimation, introduction to optimal control. \n3. Reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (activator-inhibitor, relations to control), \nstability of stationary solutions, Turing instability.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353264658815532,-N353264658877533,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

Such systems can either be fabricated in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) using very high scale integration (VLSI) techniques or implemented in programmable devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In both cases, very large designs are partitioned into a hierarchy of logical blocks, and by adhering to a set of standard design rules, the difficulty of integrating these blocks is dramatically reduced. The most popular approach is synchronous design with register transfer level (RTL) logic, but asynchronous designs are also possible. \n \nAlthough digital systems were traditionally designed at the schematic level, the current trend is towards hardware description languages (HDLs) that allow compact description of very complex hardware constructs. The appearance of sophisticated automatic hardware synthesis engines that implement logic directly from HDL have made HDLs the choice for new logic designs. Although the target language of this class is VHDL, other languages such as Verilog and SystemC apply the same design strategies. This course stresses the importance of viewing HDL as a way of describing real hardware, and not \"just another programming language\".", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353264659276596,-N353264659259597,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

An example is the ``world model'' of a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its environment -- needed, for instance, for navigation. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings, from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech recognition systems. There is a large number of formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally large diversity of learning algorithms. However, there is a relatively small number of fundamental challenges which are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms: most notably, the ``curse of dimensionality'' and the almost deadly-dangerous problem of under- vs.\\ overfitting. This lecture introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, mixtures of Gaussians, Parzen windows). Furthermore, the course also provides an intense refresher of the requisite concepts from probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353344755119063,-N353344755109064,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

On the other hand, those more interested in communications and signal processing will also benefit by understanding how the underlying antennas and channels can be best exploited by advanced \nalgorithms to optimize overall system performance. This lecture course stresses a mathematical treatment of antennas and propagation channels.

Multicarrier transmission (OFDM/DMT) as the most current technology in wireline and wireless transmission will be treated thoroughly. \nThe wireline channel will be highlighted. Starting from channel properties of twisted pair and coaxial cables, all current wireline transmission methods will be studied in detail.

An example is the ``world model'' of a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its environment -- needed, for instance, for navigation. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings, from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech recognition systems. There is a large number of formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally large diversity of learning algorithms. However, there is a relatively small number of fundamental challenges which are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms: most notably, the ``curse of dimensionality'' and the almost deadly-dangerous problem of under- vs.\\ overfitting. This lecture introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, mixtures of Gaussians, Parzen windows). Furthermore, the course also provides an intense refresher of the requisite concepts from probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353344755119063,-N353344755109064,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

The presentations will summarize the introduction, methods, results and critically evaluate a scientific paper assigned to you (15 minutes in total). The following discussion will be led by the presenter. Each student in the auditorium should prepare 2-3 questions/comments for the discussion in advance. For one or two classes written home work will be requested. More details will be given in class and alternative formats might be offered. \n \nFor the essay, you discuss one essay questions using scientific evidence (1500 words, APA style, Times New Roman, double spaced, 12 pt). The essay should go beyond what is covered in class and relies on your independent literature research. It must be submitted through TurnitIn and will be checked for plagiarism. Any violation of the Code of Academic Integrity will lead to a fail. More information about formal requirements and essay questions will be announced during the course. \n \nQuizzes will be in the form of multiple-choice or true/false questions and given at the beginning of a course. If you are late and miss the quiz, all questions will be counted as \u0093false\u0094. About 5 quizzes will be distributed during the semester and they will be graded in total. \n \nActive participation in class includes, for example, discussion of lectures and presentations on basis of pre-formulated questions, application of presented concepts to real-life situations, or other transfer activities. \n \nStudents may earn extra credit for the course by participating in research opportunities announced in class or by other means. Research opportunities must be approved by the instructor in order to count toward extra credit.

Biological (e.g. genetic) and contextual (e.g. experience) influences on brain development over the lifespan are addressed. Plasticity of the brain across the lifespan is emphasized. Plasticity is the ability of the nervous system to respond to changed demands and, thus, underlies learning and adaptive behavior. Development of the cerebral cortex and behavioral outcomes are explored in the context of environmental effects that can amplify or inhibit adaptive capacity. Neural malleability is maximal in early development, but the capacity for change in the nervous system is maintained throughout life including old age. Normal age development of the brain is contrasted to pathological changes that appear in some diseases of old age. Consequences of normal and non-normal development and aging and the influence of lifestyle factors (e.g., a physically active lifestyle, continued education) are discussed. Students will leave the course with an understanding of brain-behavior-environment interactions in lifespan developmental outcomes. Students will train their research, presentation and writing skills by critically evaluating scientific evidence.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353204287250109,-N353204287238110,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

The script language Perl will be introduced and students will \nbe trained to write own applications and to program bioinformatics algorithms and methods. It \nwill give a practical introduction and an overview on available and frequently applied sequence \nanalysis methods including the software to align and compare sequences and to predict coding \nand non-coding regions. Multiple alignment methods will be used to align several sequences \nand to identify conserved elements. In addition, computational methods for the prediction of \nprotein and RNA secondary structure will be introduced and applied to selected examples. The \ngeneration of a SQL data base in combination with a script language will be introduced. \nPart 2: Genomics. In the second part of the lab course (Genomics) hands on in genome \nanalysis will be obtained. Starting with a students seminar on a special topic related to genome \nresearch every week, several tools will be tested and used for sequence analysis. We will use \nweb-bases systems as well as standalone tools installed on a local server. Complete genomes as \nwell as genomic fragments will be analysed.

HTS is a main selective tool in big-scale research programs like drug discovery. Methods of HTS are basically methods of analytical biochemistry (photometry, purification, electrophoresis, kinetic assay, radioisotopes, immunoassay, descriptive statistics, regression analysis, etc), that is why HTS course explicitly covers these subjects, because firm knowledge of methods of analytical biochemistry is crucially important for assay design, its validation, and following data analysis and decision making. During the course we also will learn principles of the various detection techniques (light absorption, fluorescence, readioisotope technique). Consequently, the pivot part of the HTS is assay design, where detection techniques are one of the essential parts, and following statistical treatment of the results will lead to making of the decision. Also we will learn physical principles and operational basics of many analytical biochemical instruments used for multi-sample analysis (microplate readers, scintillation counters) as well as consumables for the HTS. In this course we will cover state of the art technologies including automated liquid handling machines (robots) and techniques used in HTS. A focus will be on genetic engineering techniques and screening systems involved. Additionally required automation and engineering approaches will be covered in detail. The goal is to \nprovide students with a background that enables them to successfully implement HTS strategies in real world applications of high-tech industry by mining the created diversity and finding the needle in haystack.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353403407534510,-N353403407510511,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

It is the fundamental basis of applied biotechnology when it is applied to and used to study processes in the natural environment. Environmental Biotechnology could also imply that one try to harness biological process for commercial uses and exploitation. The growing concern over the quality of our environment demands prevention of polluting releases in the ecosystem and treatment of pollutants already there. The lecture course will deal with aerobic and anaerobic treatment of waste water. The most important part a waste-water cleaning plant is the biological part. During several hours of stay a considerable part of the pollution is removed by bacteria and the BOD5 (biological oxygen demand) is reduced by 85 to 95% during the waste-water treatment. Modern waste-water treatment plants do a good job for the removal of the organic matter. The problem nowadays is the removal of nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate) and phosphate from waste-water. The essential processes are nitrification (i.e. oxidation of ammonia to nitrate) and denitrification (i.e. the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen). These processes cannot proceed at the same time or in the same place because nitrification needs high oxygen concentration (oxygen concentration above 2mg/l) whereas denitrification needs anaerobic condition (oxygen concentration lower than 0.1 mg/l). All the different aerobic and anaerobic biological processes that are involved in the elimination of organic pollution from waste water and soil will be discussed in the course.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353403407779534,-N353403407763535,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

This course tends to reach a better understanding on how eukaryotic cells interact with each other in order to form tissues that make up organs such as e.g. the heart, intestine, kidney, liver or the thyroid gland. The focus of the course will be on cellular differentiation to distinct types of cells and their integration into certain organs thereby enabling and maintaining life of an organism. As the course deals with physiology of eukaryotic cells, we will also have to include pathophysiology by discussing common and rare diseases afflicting our body's organs and cells. \nThe course will be held in an interactive lecture style with active participation of the Students. The course material will comprise a selection of textbooks, review articles and original research papers dealing with cells and their function in tissues and organs. Students will contribute by presenting research papers of their own choice or following the suggestions of the Instructor. Student presentations will be included into the respective lecture topics as talks or posters. In depth discussions of specific topics is expected from this as well as related courses in this specialization area (see Handbook for a comprehensive list of our offers).

For Logistics, one on the winners of global dynamics, project management also creates the framework for organizational flexibility and ability to adapt to change. In research and practice, project management is of increasing importance and correspondingly accepted to balance the competing project constraints of scope, quality, schedule, budget, resources and risk. (PROJECT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE (2008)). On the individual level, project management knowledge can be considered to be one of the basic skills today. \n \nAim of the Course: \nIn this course, students will learn the theoretical, strategic and practical aspects of international project management on a highly standardized level. The transfer will be guaranteed by sequentally writing a project handbook following a process model including methods and tools for project leaders. \n \nLearning Outcome: \nStudents will \u00eddentify the relevance of international standardized project managament, the different steps to implement, plan, steer and finish a project, to manage esp. risks and opportunities, identify the relevance and influence of stakeholders and environmental and the importance of continuos tracking and learning. Since project management is always team work, students will also form teams and evaluate the success factors of horizontal cooperation. \n \nCurriculum: \n1.

During the past half a century, logistics has emerged from a set of issues discussed within the marketing field to a scientific discipline on its own mainly because of its high relevance to practice. Logistics deals with the economic networks and the related flows of goods, people, money and information. Logistics discipline is of eclectic nature. As a result, logistics requires methods and tools, insights and experiences from multiple disciplines in order to provide a holistic view for the complex problems arising from the real-world. Among the marketing and military science, logistics works together with fields such as economic, computer science, mathematics, psychology, biology and strategic management. \nFor students pursuing a master of science in International Logistics it is crucial to understand the discipline of logistics and its characteristics, as well as its transdisciplinary influences. Therefore, this course aims at introducing the students to logistics as a scientific, academic discipline. In this manner, the course will introduce numerous scientific methods and approaches in general and their applicability for logistics in particular. Moreover, this course focuses on the development of research and writing skills necessary for successfully managing an advanced course of studies in Logistics on one side and contributing to the research discourse of Logistics on the other side. In fact, Scientific Skills are essential not only in the logistics academic world, but in today\u0092s highly complex world where we have to process reliable and well-founded information constantly, therefore, in the professional world. To be able to manage daily business, it is crucial to be informed and to possess the best tools to extract information from a variety of sources. Skills to produce a variety of texts for different academic and professional assignments are of equal importance. \n \nSpecific topics and issues covered include: \n? Academic sources, referencing, in-text quotations, bibliography, Academic English features, avoiding unintentional plagiarism and academic integrity issues; \n? Reading and writing (topic selection, research question formulation, summarizing and result-oriented reporting, scientific structure, norms and vocabulary); \n? Various approaches to research (analytical versus empirical types of theory building approaches, various aspects of research methodologies such as sample size, timeframe, data analysis and data selection, issues related to various methodological approaches); \n? Research in logistics (main topics and their practical relevance, important academic journals and conferences) \n \nThis course is based on lectures, group work, and self-study components. Students will deliver presentations, posters and written assignments and a feedback loop will be in place through individual appointments. Students will be introduced to research resources available at Jacobs University Bremen\u0092s Information Resource Center (IRC) and then asked to search for their own academic materials to prepare presentations, posters and written assignments.

Its goal is to develop calculus in a rigorous manner and \nin sufficient generality to prepare the student for advanced work in mathematics. At the same \ntime, the content is chosen so that students arrive quickly at central concepts which are used in \nessentially all mathematics courses, and which are needed in the exact sciences. \nThe Analysis sequence begins with a quick review of natural, rational and real numbers \n(which are assumed as known), and introduces the field of complex numbers. The axiom of \ncompleteness distinguishes the real numbers from the rationals and marks the beginning of \nAnalysis. The complex exponential and trigonometric functions are defined. \nMetric spaces are introduced and used to define continuity and convergence in a general \nframework. The Bolzano-Weierstra\u00df and the Heine-Borel theorems are proved. The intermediate \nand maximal value theorems for functions on the real line are discussed as consequences \nof connectedness and compactness on metric spaces. Sequences of functions are discussed, in \nparticular uniform convergence, as well as the continuity, differentiability, integrability of the \nlimit function. \nDifferentiability of functions on the real line is introduced. The mean value theorem and \nTaylor\u0092s theorem is discussed. \nThe Riemann integral in one variable is introduced. The relation between the derivative and \nthe integral, i.e., the fundamental theorem of calculus is proved. \nThis course has no formal prerequisites; incoming students with a strong mathematics background \nare encouraged to take this class in their first semester.

It \nintroduces vector spaces and linear maps, which play an important role throughout mathematics \nand its applications. \nThe course begins by introducing the concept of a vector space over an arbitrary field (for \nexample, the real or complex numbers) and the concept of linear independence, leading to the \nnotion of \u0093dimension\u0094. We proceed to define linear maps between vector spaces and discuss \nproperties such as nullity and rank. Linear maps can be represented by matrices and we show \nhow matrices can be used to compute ranks and kernels of linear maps or to solve linear systems \nof equations. \nIn order to study some geometric problems and talk about lengths and angles, we introduce \nan additional structure called the inner or scalar product on real vector spaces. Properties \nof Euclidean vector spaces and orthogonal maps are treated, including the Cauchy-Schwarz \ninequality, Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization and orthogonal and unitary groups. \nAn endomorphism is a linear map from a vector space to itself and is represented by a \nsquare matrix. We study the trace and determinant of endomorphisms and matrices and discuss \neigenvalues and eigenvectors. We discuss the question whether a matrix is diagonalizable and \nstate the theorem on Jordan Normal Form which provides a classification of endomorphisms. \nThis course has no formal prerequisites; incoming students with a strong mathematics background \nare encouraged to take this class in their first semester.

Research of this type has not only resulted in a better understanding of physics, but has also led to new, important developments in mathematics. The converse is also true with mathematicians' contributions being more often of a bottom-up nature, i.e., deriving results starting from a mathematical foundation. In the lectures of this course certain of the mathematical foundations of mathematical physics will be presented. They will of course be motivated by problems from physics and applications to physics will be given following the bottom-up principle. \nFor example, the basics of modern symplectic geometry will be presented and as a consequence fundamental results in classical mechanics will be proved. Quantum mechanics will be built on the foundation of the theory of group representations which uses important methods from geometry and analysis. In this context basic tools involving, e. g. tensor calculus and the spectral theory for operators such as Laplacians, will be presented. Guage theories will be discussed from the viewpoint of fiber bundles. Asymptotic analysis in certain interesting geometric and random matrix contexts will lead to results in semiclassical physics. \n \nThe course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students of Mathematics and Physics. The only prerequisite for the course is a background in basic analysis and linear algebra. All concepts and relevant methods will be explained starting from these minimal prerequisites.

The course content is transdisciplinary and is divided into three modules: \n \n(1) Earth Surface System: The \"Critical Zone\" is the complex near-surface environment in which interactions between rock, soil, water, air and living organisms define the natural habitat and control the availability of live-sustaining resources. In this module, participants will be introduced in a qualitative way to the basic components of and fundamental processes operating in the critical zone. \n \n(2) Human Interaction with the Environment: It will be demonstrated how physical, chemical and biological processes interact in the geological environment and drive the functions of the ecosystem, and how human activities interfere with these natural processes. Anthropogenic changes in the ecosystem at local and global scales will be discussed, with emphasis on the degradation of the atmosphere, freshwater systems, soils, forests, grassland and cropland and the changes of polar and coastal regions. Strategies are proposed for controlling environment degradation from extraction and consumption of Earth resources and for maintaining a healthful and sustainable earth. \n \n(3) Earth, Energy and Sustainability: \"Energy\" is a multi-dimensional topic that provides several vantage points for understanding sustainability issues. Conventional energy is sourced from the earth, which causes environmental degradation, and energy use is the primary cause of greenhouse gases and climate change. Nonetheless, energy is crucial for development. The challenge is sourcing and using it in a sustainable manner. In this module, students will learn about the sustainability movement, climate change and basic energy facts.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353594630783866,-N353594630795867,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

The fundamental processes analysed and discussed in this course are chosen according to their relevance to a planet with carbon-based life that persists over geological timescales. Such processes are: energy flow, multiple guilds, ecological tradeoffs and biodiversity, ecological hypercycles, merging of organismal and ecological physiology, carbon sequestration and photosynthesis. Nutrient cycling will be described as an emergent property of these fundamental processes. Fascinating aspects such as the reasons why a biosphere based on a single species with no nutrient cycling is very unlikely to exist or the possibility that feedbacks between organisms and their environment have helped to maintain habitable conditions on Earth will be explored. By studying the fundamental processes governing the ecology of our planet one can gain a deep understanding of its functioning from an Earth system perspective. The ideas and concepts discussed during the course will be formulated in the context of biology, ecosystem services and conservation biology. \nA module (8 academic hours) on computational ecology will be part of this course. \n \nModule on Computational Ecology \nThe module on computational ecology will consist of brief theoretical lectures and specific laboratory exercises to introduce the students to exponential, logistic, and nutrient-limited growth models.

It will lead to a better understanding of basic processes, such as tides, wind stress, topographic effects on turbulence, and exchange flow. The vertical and horizontal mixing and residence times of particles important to biological and geological processes will be discussed. The goal of biogeochemical oceanography is to understand what controls the abundances, kinds, and temporal variations of organisms in the sea, which are related tothe flow of organic matter. Progress toward this goal usually entails identifying the patterns of variability in space and time, determining the processes producing and maintaining the patterns, then quantifying the processes.

Organocatalysis is now a third option, providing competitive, as well as complementary, solutions for the synthesis of diastereo- and enantioenriched pharmaceutical drugs and natural products. The underlying premise is that low molecular weight chiral organic molecules can be designed and employed for the catalytic activation of achiral starting materials culminating in asymmetric bond formation. The catalysis concepts originate from Bronsted acid and base chemistry and rely heavily on covalent activation and/or strong chiral counter ion effects. When bifunctional organocatalysts are used, weaker (noncovalent) attractive forces (notably hydrogen bonding) become important. Incorporation of these concepts into small all organic catalysts that fine-tuned with the required steric and electronic features allow chemists to control the trajectory, facial approach, and conformation of reacting chemical partners. Students interested in this course will also feel comfortable with the basics of enzymatic pathways (biochemistry), and the overarching principles noted in the first year of organic chemistry. The course will strengthen and expand on those foundations to allow a clearer picture of the critical stereocontrol elements required for natural product synthesis and by extension pharmaceutical drugs.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353385103792931,-N353385103786932,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

It discusses basic methods commonly used by physicists, chemists, and life scienctists to characterize molecular systems of interest. It starts with a general introduction to basic interactions between atoms and molecules and their environment, needed to understand the working principles of experimental techniques. The main part focusses on the individual experimental technique including X-ray diffraction, NMR, mass spectrometry, optical spectroscopy, microscopy, light scattering, calorimetry and electrochemistry. Some basic concepts from physics and physical chemistry and a certain basic mathematical background are necessary to understand the working principle of the different instruments. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we will discuss the theoretical background and application of the different methods, complemented by visits of Jacobs research labs using those analytical instruments. \nThe course serves as an introductory course to analytical techniques for MSc students. It can also serve as a specialization for 3rd year undergraduate students in physics, chemistry, or other majors interested in an overview of modern experimental techniques in physical chemistry, biophysics, analytical chemistry or mateial science.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N354324811946246,-N354324811905247,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "1.

This course introduces students to fundamental ideas on why organizations exist, how people behave in organizations, how organizations can be designed and changed strategically, and how they evolve in their environments. Managers also need to build and maintain inter-organizational relationships in projects, alliances, networks, supply chains and partnerships with various other organizations and in increasingly international contexts.

The origins of North American society in a mixture of indigenous, European, and African influences at the same time provides an excellent paradigm for analyzing problems of cultural identity, of settler societies and post-colonial legacies, and of today's \"multiculturalism\". At the same time, the United States, as the only remaining \"super-power\" in the 21st century and as the leader in defining the world's popular culture, has an impact on the past and present of all other world region's that needs to be explained and understood. A third rationale for this course is the American model of education around which IUB is built; hence, a deeper understanding of American culture is expected to be part of the history students' education. - As a lecture, this course provides an overview of North American history from pre-Columbian beginnings to the late twentieth century. Students will be introduced to the major themes and problems in British colonial America, and in the national history of the United States; at the same time, they learn about interpretations and historiographical concepts relating to American history (e.g., \"American exceptionalism\").

As many topics in modern European history are addressed more extensively in more specific courses in modules II to IV, and since some of this history is familiar to most students from their high school history courses, the objective of this lecture is an introduction to a historical understanding and interpretation of major processes in those two centuries, and the emphasis therefore is rather on historical concepts and interpretations than on summarizing facts and events. As part of the World Regions and Civilizations module, the course will also try to sensitize students to the particular identity of a common European history, as opposed to the recent history of other world regions. On the other hand, students will learn about the diversity of European cultures and the most important \"sub-regions\" of modern European history. Topics include the transformation of Ancien R\u00e9gimes and revolutionary change; the emergence of industrial societies and economies; the formation of nation-states and empire-building, modern political ideologies such as liberalism, nationalism, or socialism; war, dictatorship and the European dimensions of the Holocaust; post-war prosperity and environmental changes.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353393609266014,-N353393609266015,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

Kippenberg", "Catalogue": "Fall > Humanities and Social Sciences > Humanities > Undergraduate Level Courses", "Official Course Description": "The notion of world religions was coined at the end of the 19th century and refers to religions that are spreading independently of territory, language, and nation. Religions of this type emerged, when prophets rejected given social norms and propagated new values. Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism established a split between an existing social reality and a sacred and just order. The religious institutions of temple and synagogue, of church and sects, of mosques, orders, and temples preserved and transmitted that message; a corpus of sacred texts became the source for practical attitudes to the world; a class of learned authorities was responsible for their interpretation. \nThis legacy shaped these religions in the modern age. Constitutive to a modern culture is an interior rift. While the present age is seen as superior to past and foreign cultures with regard to technology and science, past and foreign cultures are acknowledged as preserving a value of their own. When philosophers in the age of Enlightenment levelled profound criticism against any trust in transmitted truth claims and favoured their replacement by a reasonable religion, they met opposition by other intellectuals who saw in the history of religions a manifestation of a power uncontrollable by human reason, but part of human existence. \nThe Biblical account of the redemption of Israel from the bondage in Egypt became a powerful metaphor for an enduring longing for redemption and for practical experiments with truth. New meanings of history and of nature were retrieved from the tradition that contradict secular beliefs in progress and rationality (Apocalypticism; Esotericism). In Judaism Messianism, Kabbalah, and Hasidism established forms of religiosity that had an impact on the culture and politics of modern Israel. Christianity developed out of Jewish Messianism and taught from its very beginning diverse paths of redemption from an irrational world. Islam emerged as a religion of a sacred community dedicated to common ritual practices and mutual solidarity. When the transmitted Islamic order collapsed under the impact of Western colonialism, new leaders emerged and turned a habitus of quietism into an active subjective religiosity e.g. Islamism, Jihadism, Salafism. Western colonialism likewise challenged Hinduism that became a religion of its own only in the 19th century, though its heritage derived from earliest times. Typical to modern Hinduism are the Bhagavad-Gita and Mohandas Ghandi\u0092s practice of non-violent resistance against Colonialism. These new forms of religiosity derive their persuasive power from their ability to define the situation of human beings in the modern world.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353393727805085,-N353393727859086,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

The dynamics of globalization and migration creates multicultural and multilingual situations with specific tensions, problems and chances. Especially the national states with their monocultural and monolingual traditions face radically new social challenges which are discussed in theories of multiculturalism. Tensions arise between the old national languages (and the traditional regional languages), the languages of the immigrants and the new global language English: What language shall be used in public education, what shall be the position of the languages of the migrants in the public life of the states? What is the role of global English in these transformations? Is the spread of global English a case of linguistic imperialism, is it responsible for the death of languages, does it create a new aristocracy in the European countries? How does the European Union deal with the plurality of its languages? The course sheds light on these processes and tensions as mirrored in literature. It examines how multilingual authors have become a constitutive part of the literary scene, thus reshaping the concept and scope of literature, and in which way the regional and culturally homogenous mode of literary production is challenged by a global type of discourse and practice.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N354245538042930,-N354245538099931,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

That\u0092s why these have been influential, even up until today. Now, in our age of globalization, there\u0092s more need for us to review and to rethink these fundamental key ideas, as actually expressed by those thinkers, in this case the seven seminal Chinese thinkers, namely, Kongzi (Confucius), Mozi, Mengzi (Mencius), Laozi, Zhuangzi, Xunzi, and Han Feizi. So this course is intended as a mirror for those from other cultures to relativize themselves so as to arrive at 'New Axial Age' formulations through cross-cultural dialogues and mutual appreciation. But do not be intimidated by this grandiose aim: we go basically with one book, and only some parts of their most important writings.

It stresses the differences between the main sources of international law (article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice), always in relations to judgements of international courts, national courts or even arbitral awards. It discusses the general principles of international law in relations to the North Sea Continental Shelf Case (Federal Republic of Germany vs. Denmark and the Netherlands) and the case of the diversion of water from the river Meuse (Netherlands vs. Belgium). The relations between international law and municipal law give rise to questions according to cases of the European Court of Human Rights and of the German Federal Constitutional Court. The subjects of international law are discussed focusing on the qualification of States as a subject of International Law according to the Montevideo Convention and on recent questions like that of failed States (e.g. Somalia) or on situations near to secession (e.g. Kosovo, Transnistria, Ossetia etc.) The principle of self-determination in the UN-Charta has played a major role in the formation of newly independent States and has influenced the development of the rules on state-succession. Beside States, international organizations and recently the individual are playing a more and more prominent role as subjects of international law. How can the position of the individual as a subject of international law be justified and what is its status in the field of human rights? \n \nThe course focuses also on territory as an important element of the notion of State besides the population and state authority and sovereignty. Transfer of territory is as well discussed as the importance of discovery as a title to territory. Another chapter of the course deals with land boundaries and other boundaries and the extent of state jurisdiction (the Lotus-case and the case concerning the arrest warrant by a Belgium judge for the congolese foreign minister (Democratic Republic of Congo vs. Belgium). State immunity has undergone a very rapid recent development which is explained in relation to quite a number of cases. \n \nAnother chapter deals with the law of the sea and of state responsibility, the treatment of aliens and the protection of property, the law of treaties and the development of human rights. A chapter of the course is devoted to the use of force by States, the problem of intervention and the limitations of self-defence. The concluding chapter deals with judicial control and protection by international and national courts and makes the students familiar with the techniques of legal argumentation.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353884542918335,-N353884542957336,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "9.

From a Cognitive Science perspective, the study of cognition typically is construed as the search for those aspects of mental experience that are uniformly true for all. In fact for much of the 20th century most psychologists assumed that all normal human beings were equipped with the same set of attentional, perceptual, memorial, learning, and inferential procedures. From a Cultural Studies perspective, there is no avoiding the cultural framework within which individuals think and act. The idea of universal mental experiences is often rejected outright by many cultural theorists; every human thought and perception is uniquely situated within a very specific framework informed by history, tradition, language, social context, etc. The goal of this seminar is to explore the dynamic of both perspectives by asking which aspects of human thinking and judgment are universally the same or culturally shaped. \nIn particular the following issues and questions will be addressed: \n \n- Definitions of culture and dimensions of cultural comparisons \n- Methodological challenges of studying culture's influences \n- Culture and systems of thought: Analytic versus holistic thinking \n- Causal attribution across cultures: How fundamental is the fundamental attribution error? \n- Cultural differences in reasoning: Western logic versus Eastern dialectics \n- The self-concept in a cross-cultural perspective: Independent versus interdependent self-construals \n- Culture and context: How flexible are cross-cultural variations in self-construals? \n- Does thinking about the self influence thinking in general? \n- Direct versus indirect communication in different cultures \n- Characteristics of cross-cultural interaction: Working in multi-cultural teams \n- Intercultural trainings \n \nThis seminar provides an introduction to important theoretical approaches from both Cognitive and Social Psychology as well as from adjacent other disciplines, like Anthropology or Ethnology. The discussed research findings may, however, help to improve cross-cultural interaction in many applied fields.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353393685925062,-N353393685919063,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

However, context also refers to other factors that influence how an object or a person is perceived, such as the mood, the expectations, the needs and the prior knowledge of a perceiver. Other Social Psychology issues of interest include how people interact, how inter-group conflict can be understood, and when people help each other or aggress against each other. \nThis lecture will review important aspects of social psychological research, which then will be discussed in more detail in 2nd and 3rd year seminars. These aspects include: \n \n- History of Social Psychology: A brief history of the origins of Psychology and the development of Social Psychology as an own discipline. \n- Basic concepts and methods of Social Psychology \n- Classic theories: Attribution theory, dissonance theory, and self perception theory, etc. \n- Person perception and social encoding: Which features are salient and which drive our evaluation? What affects our attitudes and our evaluation of people? \n- Person memory: Which information is remembered? \n- Stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination: The concept of stereotypes and their consequences. How can stereotypes be changed? \n- Social inference: How do judgments and decisions change according to the social contexts? Heuristics and biases. Bad and good decision-making. \n- Automatic social cognition: Basic concepts, theories, and experiments on the ongoing consciousness debate. Are all our judgments malleable? Is most of our behaviour produced unintentionally? \n- Inter-group conflict and behaviour: How can inter-group conflict be understood and resolved? What produces it? How can it be prevented? \n- Social Identity and the self: How can the self be understood from a social psychological perspective? \n- Communication: Theories of communication. Group work and group performance. Communication problems. \n- Mood: Social Psychological theories of mood. The influences of mood on cognition. The influence of cognition on mood. Mood and behaviour. \n- Motivation: Theories of needs and goals. Behaviour in the social context. Achievement motivation. Aggression and pro-social behaviour.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353393685884042,-N353393685847043,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "1.

These complex social psychological phenomena involve basic cognitive and affective processes in individuals as much as processes related to group norms, intergroup relations, and social construction in a given socio-cultural context. \nThe course covers the conceptualization and measurement of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination and, with consideration of multiple levels of analysis, their various sources as well as approaches to combating them. More specifically, the topics covered in the course include: \n \n-Prevalence of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination in society (e.g. at the workplace, in education); cultural differences \n-The target's perspective: consequences of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. stereotype threat, self-fulfilling prophecy) \n-History of research on stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination \n-Research methods and measurement of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. implicit and explicit measures, old-fashioned and modern racism/sexism) \n-Levels of analysis and different theoretical approaches (e.g. social cognition, social norms and identities, inter-group conflict) \n-The mental representation of stereotypes: person memory (schema, prototype, exemplar models), models of stereotype change \n-Cognitive and affective factors involved in stereotype activation and application (e.g. social categorization, automaticity, mood, motivation, self-esteem) \n-Individual differences in stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. personality, authoritarianism, social dominance orientation) \n-Social identity: the role of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination for group identity \n-Intergroup relations: how stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination depend on the relations between groups in society (e.g. competition for resources, intergroup threats) \n-Strategies to combat stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (stereotype suppression, contact hypothesis, Jigsaw classrooms, political correctness norms, collective action, societal and legal changes.)", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353393685916054,-N353393685954055,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

In this course, you learn to distinguish wicked from tame environmental problems, and gain insight into the policies and institutions with which wicked environmental issues can be successfully resolved. In the process, you come to understand the alternative views of time, space, risk, nature, human nature, technology and democracy that stakeholders in debates about wicked environmental problems believe in. You are also introduced to a leading social theory with which to better understand these issues.

Upon completion of the course, students should be able to think critically about both the nature of the problems facing states today and how states respond.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000125,-N0,-N353384761245588,-N353384761254589,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

By studying different styles of music as well as various aspects of music theory and the mathematical concepts involved, the course aims to provide the students with a foundation to apply statistical processes for musical analysis. Beginning with a history of the study, followed by an in depth analysis and theoretical foundation, and ending with an independent student project, the course offers theoretical basis leading to practical application. Group projects will involve developing a method for statistically analyzing a live stream of biometric data (e.g. movement of a participant in interactive installation or a dancer on stage) and creatively manipulating it using algorithms and filters to generate a contemporary sound composition. An approach to sonification of data will be used to gain insight into periodicities and patterns within the data itself. Given that sound offers a myriad of qualities, data may be mapped to any number of sound parameters, thus opening up new ways to understand data or information, and even reveal formerly hidden structures and meaning. \nArtists, practitioners and lecturers from relevant areas of the arts, statistics, and psychology sectors, will be invited to contribute to this course. In addition, analysis/demonstrations of recent interactive performances realized by the author and other artists will provide a hands-on opportunity to better understand the creative and technological processes.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N352225045087497,-N352225045003498,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

There is, nevertheless, the common understanding that each society has law and that the function of such law is providing rules for the organisation of that society, including the behaviour of its members. \n \nListening to ordinary voices, we hear that certain behaviour is called \u0093unethical\u0094, or \u0093immoral\u0094. This can happen when somebody acts in a specific way, which is seen to be in violation of ethical standards or moral obligations, or a person does not act at all although he / she was expected to act. For some, including scholars of philosophy, ethics and moral (and / or the morals) are used interchangeable. Others draw a distinction between ethics and moral. According to this, ethics is part of philosophy and as such the meta-level which reflects on norms, be them legal or non-legal. In this sense, the moral norms in a society, which are not necessarily included in the respective legal order, are subject of ethics. \n \nEthics reflects normative perceptions. Ethical discourses collect and research the social foundation of moral perception. Ethics describes, questions, reasons, substantiates and develops normative perceptions, standards and rules. The various theories of ethics, theories reaching from Aristotle to Kant, from Rawls to modern proponents of hermeneutical ethics contribute to the vast field of ethics in their specific manner. Ethical reflections explore the viability of the ethical instruments submitted by ethical theory for the ethical solution of problems, including problems described as \u0093ethical dilemmas\u0094. However, the bigger part of the ethical discourse focuses on approaches to ethics in the philosophy of the western world and, with this, addresses the Western move to the secular state and the subsequent emphasis on (secular) ethics. Questions about ethics and the relationship of ethics and law in other frames of thoughts, e.g. the Islamic, the African or the Chinese frame of thought, in particular, require attention when problems arising from cultural diversities have to be dealt with. \n \n Teaching credits (non-public):\n 2", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N352553515932339,-N352553515957340,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "6.

The relationship between the two concepts \u0093society\u0094 and \u0093technology\u0094 is subject to continuous adaptation. We shall explore the relationship based our expertise and on the scientific literature on knowledge creation and innovation processes. Based on the concept of \u0093creative destruction\u0094 coined by Schumpeter as a driver of economic and social change we investigate throughout the course the distinction between incremental development versus radical innovation. Examples of innovation processes range from energy, transport, architecture, military, fashion, press and social media to biological innovation. \nHaving introduced the basic concepts for analyses of such innovation processes students will carry out own projects or case studies of specific technological or societal innovations. Within these projects, the social and economic process of what leads to the innovation as well as the likely or already observed impact of the innovation will be investigated. Students can choose an innovation process of their choice in agreement with the course instructors and prepare a presentation and written documentation of this process.

Who is healthy? Which behaviors are health related in which people? How can we support individuals adopting and maintaining healthy lifestyles? \nIn western industrialized nations, an increasing amount of people reach old and very old age whilst birth rates decline. This trend coincides in an increasing need to promote a healthy lifestyle and in turn to promote successful and productive aging. \nThe USC will provide you with multiple facets of health ranging from different health models and health behaviour models to different lifestyle factors that promote health across the lifespan. Further you will get hands on tools to assess health and successfully improve health behavior. We will investigate different options on campus which might be health (behaviour) related i.e. might improve or impede health (behaviour) or might be an environment to study health related topics. Students are expected to work on small group projects which will be presented in the end of this course in form of posters. \n \n Teaching credits (non-public):\n 2", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N352575263319058,-N352575263309059,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

You will learn how to fulfill simple everyday life tasks in Spanish. For example, amongst other competences, you will be able to introduce yourself in a professional or a personal setting, to book a ticket, understand somebody indicating you an itinerary or order something in a restaurant. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to perform concrete tasks: describe your activities, your habits, understand a cooking recipe or talk about your hobbies.

We will work on press articles, abstract of novels or films on a variety of topics such as shared apartments, music festivals and university or work environment in Spain and Latin America. At the end of the B1 level, students should be able to cope with most of the situations one might be faced to on a trip in a country where Spanish is spoken. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to, for example, describe your academic background to a future employer (use of past tenses), give your point of view and debate on a variety of subjects (different ways of expressing consequences, aims\u0085) or help you to understand the main points of a radio or a TV broadcast. Also we will read a short novel.

On \nthe conceptual level, mastering the rapidly growing volume and complexity of information in \nindustry, science, and society requires improved modelling and design methodologies. On the \nimplementation level, existing storage, retrieval, and delivery techniques have to be revisited \nand new ones have to be designed in order to meet the challenges formulated conceptually. \nWhile these issues largely fall into the fields of databases, information retrieval, and Internet \ntechnology, the questions arising clearly transcend these fields and call for interdisciplinary \nresearch on more efficient and effective methods. \nThe course, therefore, starts with an overview of existing knowledge in the core fields and then \ncovers selected themes in more depth. Among the candidate themes are non-standard applications \nsuch as spatio-temporal databases and sensor networks, distributed databases, XML \ndatabases, multimedia databases, streams, raster databases, storage structures, and query optimization. \nGoal is to make students familiar with the state of the art in Web-enabled information systems \nso that they will be successful database/Internet professionals in IT industry and also have a \nsound knowledge base to specialize towards a scientific career in the field.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351635448952763,-N351635448917764,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

In recent years, fundamentally new techniques have been introduced which enable researchers to gain new insights into processes (e.g. structural and functional neuroimaging, magnetoencephalography), or to specifically manipulate them (e.g. optogenetical methods), respectively. Apart from basic research, these new techniques and the well-established other methods (e.g. EEG, various behavioral and cognitive psychological tests) are very important in clinical investigations. In this respect, the understanding of neurodegenerative processes is of particular importance since early signs may be discovered well before first clinical signs of the disease occur, thus leading to better diagnosis and treatment options.

A biotechnologist has to master current industrial bioprocessing practise, from the microbial or cell producer (bioreaction) to the highly purified, formulated product. He/she must be able to design and optimize new processes, calculate for biological reactors, and develop efficient recovery and purification procedures (downstream processing). In this course students will learn how to design a bioprocessing \"train\". Important aspects are: Operating considerations for microbial fermentations, cell bioreactors for suspension and immobilized cultures, Selection, scale-up, and operation of bioreactors and enzyme reactors, Primary recovery and purification of products, Bioprocess considerations in using animal cell cultures, plant cell cultures, and genetically engineered organisms, among others. Practical demonstrations may take place during the course. Students will utilize a software package for process design and cost evaluation. New trends in bioprocess technology will be analyzed by focusing on innovative case studies.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351594387454574,-N351594387419575,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "6.

Knowledge of the molecular basis and mode of action of many pathogen-mediated diseases has sky-rocketed in the past decades. This half-semester course is meant to familiarize the student with a selection of infectious diseases, the microbial pathogens causing them, and potential ways to heal infected persons. Although this selection of diseases can by no way be comprehensive due to time constraints, some of the most important diseases will be dealt with. For advanced participants (i.e. those who previously took the 3rd-year undergraduate Biomed and Infection Biology course) particular problem tasks for some diseases will be given. Diseases and pathogens to be dealt with include: HIV, TB, candidiosis, Salmonella, toxoplasmosis, malaria, bacterial toxins, plant pathogens, and sexually transmitted diseases. A total of 13 lectures will be followed by a final examination in the 14th time slot. Additionally, a short mid term quiz will be held. \n \nGrading: \n50% final examination \n25% mid term \n25% active participation", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351635531984825,-N351635531922826,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

The goal of this exercise is to illustrate significant effects of different types of supply control (push/pull) on indicators such as WIP, throughput time, cycle time respectively worker behaviour. Students will also be familiarized with the topics of Supply Chain Risk Management and Supply Chain Security. In a Game Based Learning exercise for Supply Chain Security the students have to act as real supply chain actors. \n \nMoreover, the course will have a strong focus on the shipping industry, students will be introduced to the ways in which shipping is organized in the modern, globalized economy. They will analyze the per item shipping costs of modern container shipping. They will also learn about the elements that affect the supply and demand side of shipping markets, about the generally assumed behaviour of the supply and demand side under the criteria of perfect competition and how the market balance is achieved in the long-run-, short-run-, and immediate market environment. Furthermore, students will have an exercise focused on one segment of heavy cargo logistics \u0096 the offshore wind sector. Students will be introduced (by means of role games) to the challenges of offshore wind energy \u0096 looking at the industry from a logistics point of view. \n \nFinally, an excursion to a logistics company in Bremen will be offered within one lab session in order to show how logistics works in the industry world.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351624061283456,-N351624061295457,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [], "Course Name Abbreviation": "NatSciLab Unit Logis", "Type": "Lab", "Name": "050112 NatSciLab Unit Logistics II"}, {"Further Grading Information": "Students are expected to participate in all lectures. \nParticipation is considered as a crucial element of the \nlearning process and can have an impact on the final grade. \nThe contents of each class should be understood before the \nbegin of the next class. \nStudents are expected to attend all lectures.

In order to accomplish this, a general introduction to the generation of corporate value is given. This is followed by an examination of different value generation and earnings models of distribution logistics providers as well as corporate logistics departments. Particular attention is paid to the two dimensions of logistics value generation, \"Service Excellence\" (effectiveness based value generation) and \"Cost Minimization\" (efficiency based value generation). The major reasons why (and how) firms measure distribution logistics performance, to reduce operating costs, drive revenue growth and enhance shareholder value are examined during the lecture and by utilizing case studies. \nThe course is divided into two main parts. For one, students are expected to attend classes and complete a number of case studies in a group setting. The cases serve to get an in-depth look at the real life implications of distribution value generation and the impact that logistics has on corporate success. The cases also train the analytical and management decision making skills of the students. \nIn addition, students have to write a 12-15 page seminar paper. Topics for the paper will be individually assigned to the students by the instructor. The paper gives the students the chance to explore some of the topics discussed in class in more depth and from a scientific as well as practical perspective. \nAfter the completion of the course students will: \n- have a solid understanding of value generation and value measurement in a distribution logistics setting \n- understand the different dimensions of the distribution logistics value proposition \n- realize the accute importance of logistics value generation in order to gain long term sustainable competitive advantages \n- be able to apply the learnings in a real world setting", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351594455814594,-N351594455824595,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "17.

This course introduces the information systems that support human dispatchers in their duties. An important foundation is the synchronisation of real-world material flows with their corresponding information flows by means of identification systems. Furthermore, logistics processes are highly distributed among departments (e.g. procurement, production, distribution) and even companies. Therefore, communication technology as a foundation for implementing distributed information systems is another topic. \n \nThe objective of this course is to enable logisticians to communicate with IT professionals in designing information systems for logistics. To this end, a focus lies on modelling information systems with respect to processes, data, information, and knowledge. Furthermore, future developments in ICT that do not only incorporate information systems but also automated control are discussed.

We introduce the dual vector space and dual linear maps and their relation \nwith bilinear forms. Classifications are given of symmetric and skew-symmetric real bilinear \nforms and of Hermitian and skew-Hermitian forms over the complex numbers. \nThe last part is concerned with tensors \u0097 objects that play an important role in many \nbranches of physics and mathematics.

Mathematical modeling of continuous-time dynamics has its origins in classical \nmechanics but is now prevalent in all areas of physical and life sciences.

Consequently, a variety of analytical \nand numerical methods have been developed to deal with various classes of equations and initial \nvalue problems, the most important of which is the class of linear equations. Other methods \n(such as Laplace transform) for solving many differential equations of special form will also \nbe discussed. The course underlines the importance of qualitative analysis of differential equations, \nwith a discussion of simple models such as the Lotka-Volterra equation. \nAll students in the School of Engineering and Science with and interest in the application \nof Mathematics to real-life problems, and have a mathematical background equivalent to either \nEngineering and Science Mathematics 1B (Multivariable Calculus, ODE) or Analysis I/II \nshould consider taking this course as a home school elective.

Lerchl) \nBiology is around us; we ourselves are components of \"biology\". To appreciate our position in nature, we need to know something about life itself, about different life forms, and the way living organisms interact with each other and with environmental features. The lectures are designed to provide the students with a taste of fundamentals of biology (reproduction, genetics, cell biology), biodiversity and the concept of ecosystems. Additionally, the fundamentals of endocrinology, chronobiology and sensory systems are covered. \n \nChemistry Module (Prof. T. Nugent) \nOur development as societies is directly shaped and advanced by our understanding, use of, and continual redefinition of the chemical sciences. Some of the foremost problems facing mankind are currently energy, environment, food, and medicine; and chemists will be there to meet those challenges. During this course we touch on foundation material as diverse as reaction stoichiometry, chemical equilibria, acids and bases, redox reactions, nuclear chemistry, carbon dating, the origins of life, photosynthesis, and fuel cells. In doing so, we will address and better appreciate mankind\u0092s challenges. The course is geared toward a student audience that has not taken General Inorganic or Organic Chemistry. \n \nPhysics module (Prof. H. Meyer-Ortmanns): \nPhysics provides the basis for understanding weather and climate, radiation and radioactivity, energy balance and pollution of various kinds. This module gives a survey on forces in nature, electromagnetic radiation and radioactivity, wave phenomena on various energy and length scales. It also reviews concepts of fluid mechanics of liquids and gases, transport of heat, mass and momentum, and the different processes behind the transport. In view of the topical discussion on renewable energy we present the various forms of energy, their mutual transformation as well as the basic physics behind nuclear power, that is nuclear fission and fusion.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351594499634611,-N351594499634612,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

The Amazon forest importantly contributes to the global biogeochemical and carbon cycles and regulates the regional and continental climate. There is growing evidence that the biota of Amazonian ecosystems is increasingly affected by climate change. Increased frequency of extreme drought and flood events particularly during the last decade puts the conservation of the Amazon forest in the forefront of public attention. However, deforestation by humans still endangers large parts of forests and locally reinforces natural climate trends. In addition, predictions of impacts of climate change on a basin-wide scale mostly fail because of the huge dimensions of the Amazon and the variability of its range of different ecosystems. \nThe course gives an introduction to the biogeography and evolutionary history of the different Amazonian ecosystems with special emphasis on Amazonian wetlands, which cover approximately 30% of the area of the biodiversity.

It is neither the traditional experimental physics lecture, nor a \npure theoretical physics course. Both aspects are combined, special emphasis is laid on general \nprinciples, not on mathematical derivations. Nevertheless, the course teaches calculus based \nphysics and some mathematical knowledge will be required. Experiments are integrated into \nthe lectures. \nThe course introduces the following topics: \n\u000f Special relativity: Lorentz transformation, rest mass. \n\u000f Quantum physics: photons, electrons, wave nature of particles; Schroedinger equation, \nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. \n\u000f Atomic physics: X-ray and atomic structure, periodic systems, spin electronic excitations, \natomic spectra. \n\u000f Molecules and condensed matter: molecular bonds and vibrations; crystals and semiconductors. \n\u000f Nuclear and particle physics: elementary particles, accelerators and detectors, quarks, \nstandard model, decay of nuclei, nuclear reactions, nuclear fusion and fission.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351623493054386,-N351623493046387,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

The assessment of the explanatory power of reductionism is a controversial issue, even between two Nobel prize winners from physics, Steven Weinberg and Phil Anderson. We shall first illustrate reductionism\u0092s success in different areas of physics: relativity theory, gauge theories of the standard \nmodel, self-organized processes like pattern formation in cosmology, the renormalization group approach in condensed matter theory, and more generally topics of multi-scale modeling. The success becomes possible due to a few guiding principles, the exploitation of symmetries, but also due to large-scale computer simulations. Therefore one may be tempted to jump to conclusions and postulate the existence of a \u0093world formula\u0094 or a \u0093theory of everything\u0094, such postulates are found in the literature until recently. Pointing out the \nlimitations of reductionism in the second part of the course, it will become clear why such postulates are not meaningful. Limitations show up when the goal is to predict not only a single aspect, but the whole variety of emergent phenomena on a higher level of description when starting from a more fundamental one. We shall also review the very formulation of physical laws in stochastic and deterministic versions, the increasing complexity in the description that one has to face if \nthe goal is to capture distinct aspects at the same time. Along with a comparison of stochastic and deterministic formulations, an important topic in the theory of evolution will be discussed. It is related to the role of contingency and necessity in time evolutions, in particular in the evolution of the universe. Here well-known representatives of opposing viewpoints are the paleontologists and biologists S. J. Gould and S. C. Morris. The reviews on topics from physics will be supplemented by some presentations from the philosophical side, discussing \ntheories of explanation in physics and biology. From illustrations of the successful application of reductionism in different branches of physics, undergraduate students are expected to receive first reviews on achievements rather than a detailed understanding. A deeper understanding can be gained upon specialization on the graduate level. On the other hand, pointing out the limitations of reductionism opens the view for the need to include other disciplines than physics to approach complex systems in all their facets.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351623493125390,-N351623493120391,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

In the first part, the concept of nanoparticles and nanoscale materials is introduced. The effect of nanoparticle size on their physical and chemical properties when going to the nanoscale is explained. The \u0091nanoworld\u0092 lies in-between the atomic scale, where quantum mechanics rule, and classical mechanics in the bulk material. This part will apply these observations on metal and ceramic nanoparticles, and special focus will also be given to the different chemical pathways used in order to obtain the most homogenous size distributions of such materials. The second part deals with an introduction to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, with a focus on applications in inorganic and materials chemistry. Initially, NMR is compared to various other analytical techniques (e.g. IR, UV-vis, Raman, XRD, EPR, M\u00f6ssbauer), and their respective advantages and disadvantages discussed (e.g. time scale, sensitivity, selectivity, sample preparation). Then a basic introduction to NMR is presented, the underlying theory of the technique as well as instrument hardware. The most important experimental aspects and NMR parameters such as chemical shift, scalar coupling, relaxation delay, decoupling, T-dependence, quadrupolar nuclei, and 2D NMR are presented. The main portion of this course deals with a discussion of actual examples of inorganic compounds from the literature. A non-mathematical, descriptive approach is used throughout. The third part of this course deals with the description of molecules and matter from a chemical point of view, with an emphasis on basic concepts of chemical bonding, including simple covalent bonds, delocalization, intermolecular interactions to create assemblies, and the mechanical bonding relevant in supramolecular and nanomolecular systems. An introduction into photonic processes will be given in terms of photochemical reactions and photoinduced electron transfer. Properties of matter are viewed in terms of thermodynamic aspects, highlighting enthalpic and entropic effects as the driving force for chemical reactions, solvent effects, isotope effects, properties of phase mixture, etc.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N352143684762596,-N352143684759597,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

The first part of the course provides foundations as basis knowledge necessary for understanding and describing nano-scale systems covering fundamental physical aspects. It covers the statistical approach to thermodynamics of multiparticle systems. Quantum statistics of electrons, vibrations and photons are introduced to calculate various thermodynamic properties. Furthermore electromagnetic fields and their modification in matter and in cavities is addressed. Throughout the first part special emphasis is given to the scaling behaviour from infinite systems to systems of finite size. \nThe second part provides a survey of the field nano-scale systems and will start off with an intrduction to imaging, characterization and manipulation techniques of nanoobjects and single molecules. This includes scanning probe microscopies (e.g. STM, AFM, SNOM) and other single molecule detections and analysis techniques (patch clamp, optical tweezers, fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy). Also, fundamental properties of nanoscale materials (confinement, size dependent properties) will be discussed. The module is rounded of by a short account of methods to create nanostructures at surfaces.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351623924020406,-N351623924036407,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

Since the field of modern economic history has witnessed a major transformation, with a significant expansion of both its subject area and its theoretical foundations, the classical process of the Industrial Revolution in technology and production will form an important starting point, but will not any more exclusively define this field. Attention will also be given to the preconditions of industrial growth in the agricultural and commercial economy of early-modern Europe. The history of economic processes has begun to include not just production, but also trade and consumption, as modern societies are increasingly defined as \"consumer societies\". In addition, the \"cultural turn\" has had its impact also on economic history, leading to a new emphasis on economic action, economic ideology, and the cultural implications of economic behavior. The lecture provides an overview over both classical and new topics in modern economic history, from early-modern beginnings to postwar economies after 1945 and issues of economic \"globalization\", and at the same time introduces students to different ways of conceptualizing past economies. The chief interest lies on Western economies, but their interrelations with local and dependent economies on the fringes of the Western world are also considered.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351715050993880,-N351715050913881,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "7.

It provides an opportunity for a more detailed study of international relations in a broad sense, i.e. including politics and transnational activities.

Through the close reading of available documents and the engagement with scholarly debates, the structure of international relations, its institutions and underlying forces, as well as major events which shaped politicians' behavior gain life. The course focuses on issues like the origins of wars, peace-making, collective security, crisis management, economic dependency and cultural diplomacy. It highlights features particular to the twentieth century; the potential of mass destruction and its realization, the role of ideologies, the expansion of international organizations, economic relations and an increasing but uneven linkage between societies all over the world.

If places are still vacant students will be allocated randomly. \n \nThis course provides a focused perspective on major processes of lasting importance to the 20th century and until today. Beginning with the Word War I and the Versailles System, the course aims at providing students with a deeper understanding of major political events and changes of international power relations. Foci will be laid on cold war, decolonization, \n \nIn contrast to usually constructed IR courses this course does not deal with major political events in chronological order, rather it intends to develop answers to crucial questions related to the understanding of shifting power relations in the 20th Century. Empires and imperial states (Germany, France, UK, Russia) were losing political importance while new states (USA, and Third World countries like Egypt, India and China after decolonization) and new challenges in the age of cold war gained more and more international attendance. This IR course deals with the following main questions: \n1. Why governments did start a world war and why didn\u0092t it end earlier (only after four years)? Topics: World War I and the Versailles System \u0096 the great watershed of the 20.th Century geo-political history or the \u0093seminal catastrophe\u0094 of the 20th Century. \n2.

What was and who or what ended the Cold War (1946/47 -1989/1991)? Did nuclear deterrence work? Topics: USA\u0092s foreign policy of containment and d\u00e9tente, Truman doctrine, Carter Doctrine; the USSR\u0092s doctrines of \u0093peaceful coexistence\u0094, Brezhnev doctrine; Gorbachev\u0092 s policy of Glasnost and Perestroika \n7. How European nation states achieved \u0093perpetual peace\u0094 (I. Kant) among themselves after 1945, i. e. economic integration and political unity of the EU? \u0096 a \u0093miracle of world-historical importance\u0094 (Robert Kagan)? Topics: The foundation of European Coal and Steel Community, Treaties of Rome, Maastricht, and Lisbon. Causes and risks of South and East enlargements of the EU. \n8. What are \u0091defensive weapons\u0092?

Sensation refers to the process of detecting a stimulus or a stimulus property in the environment. It is the necessary collection of information about the world from which perceptions will be made. Perception refers to the way in which we interpret the information that is gathered by the senses. The process of perception can not be understood while ignoring the known physiology of the sensory systems that underlies the perceptual process. The course covers both physiological explanations for phenomena of perception and more cognitive aspects of the perceptional process, for which a physiological explanation might be available in the future. \nThis lecture covers the following topics: \n \n- Methods of investigation: Phenomenological method; psychophysical methods such as methods of limits, method of constant stimuli, magnitude estimation, and basic ideas of signal detection; psychophysical measures such as absolute threshold, difference threshold, adaptation; Fechner's law, Weber's law, Stevens' power law. \n- Visual perception: The visual stimulus, the structure of the eye, neural processing including basic neural circuitry, and information flow and organization in the brain; perception of objects and models of object perception such as the Gestalt approach, feature integration theory (Treisman), recognition-by-component model (Biederman), Marr's computational approach; perception of depth, monocular depth cues, binocular depth cues; perception of color and models of color perception such as trichromatic theory, opponent-process theory; perception of movement, motion sensing systems such as image-retina system, eye-head system, corollary discharge theory; perceptual constancies such as color constancy, size constancy, lightness constancy, shape constancy; and phenomenon such as visual illusions. \n- Auditory perception: The sound stimulus, the structure of the ear, neural processing in the cochlea and auditory nerve; the experience of sound (loudness, pitch, timbre); perception of simple tones and complex sound; models such as Bekesy's Place Theory; localization of sound. \n- Touch and pain: The cutaneous stimulus; the skin and its different receptor systems; active versus passive touch; pain and pain relief, such as analgesia and endogenous opiates, placebo. \n- Smell and taste: The olfactory stimulus, the olfactory system, the taste stimulus, the taste system; pheromones; taste quality; flavor.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351715070516890,-N351715070528891,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

Decision making and decision theory are broad and complex areas of great theoretical interest and practical impact in almost all today\u0092s disciplines ranging from biology and neuroscience to computer science, economics, marketing, mathematics, political sciences, psychology to sociology or statistics. In some of these disciplines decision making has been studied for more than two centuries. \nThe focus in this lecture lies on individual decision making. The students learn about basic concepts of decision making, theories of decision making, methods to elicits values/utilities, importance weights/probabilities and shall be able to conduct a decision analysis. New directions in decision making research complement the course. Specifically, the following topics are addressed: \n\u0095 Elements of decision problems: Values, objectives, sequential decisions, uncertain events, consequences \n\u0095 Models of problem structure: Fundamental and means objectives, influence diagrams, decision trees \n\u0095 Models of uncertainty: probability and its assessment, judgments, heuristics and biases, accuracy , calibration \n\u0095 Models of preference: expected utility theory, prospect theory, models for decision making under certainty, heuristics \n\u0095 Decision analysis: Value/utility measurement, probability/ weight measurement, Multiattribute Utility Theory (MAUT), conjoint analysis, sensitivity analysis \n\u0095 Specific topics such as neuroeconomics, decision making in medicine and new approaches in the field of decision making", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351715070549892,-N351715070561893,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

Emotion and motivation interface with almost all areas of psychology and are also highly relevant in connected domains. Terms such as emotion, mood, temperament, but also motivation are often used in ways that reflect our layman's understanding of these phenomena, but that does not take into account the extensive history of scientific research into these concepts. \nThis course explores the history and tradition of scientific research on emotion and motivation. The course is to provide students with a solid understanding of the competing theoretical approaches at different levels, ranging from biological and neuroscience approaches to social and cultural concepts. In consequence the successful participants shall have the foundations required to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of applying such concepts various contexts, including in empirical research as well as in various applications. Lastly, they shall be informed of current debates and trends in emotion and motivation research. \nMajor theoretical approaches will be presented for emotion and for motivation. In each case there will be an emphasis on critical analysis and discussion of the premises and inconsistencies of the theories in the light of empirical data. The work of specific researchers or specific methods (e.g., measurement of facial activity) will be pursued in more depth. \n \nMajor theoretical approaches to emotions: \n \n- Darwinian perspective on emotions. \n- Evolutionary basis of emotions and their expressions: Jamesian Perspective of emotion. \n- Function of physiological changes associated with emotion: Cannon critique of specificity of physiological patterning; mixed models, specifically the Schachter-Singer theory of emotion and associated concepts, such as excitation transfer. \n- Cognitive perspective of emotion: Origin of the modern appraisal construct in the approaches by Arnold and Lazarus, as well as modern multidimensional concepts of appraisal (e.g., Frijda, Smith, Scherer, Roseman); the relationship of cognition and emotion will be discussed particularly in the light of the Lazarus-Zajonc debate; multiple levels of processing. \n- Social-Constructivist Perspective: Different levels of social influence on the definition, experience, and expression of emotions will be discussed (e.g. Averill's theory); display rules, feeling rules, and social schemata of physiological responses. \n \nMajor theoretical approaches to motivation: \n \n- History of the motivation concept \n- Biological approaches: Drive concept; examples such as hunger, thirst; physiological underpinnings. \n- Behavioural approaches: Learning theory in relation to motivation (Pavlov, Thorndike, Garcia); innate vs. learned behaviour; species-characteristic stereotyped behaviour. \n- Cognition and emotion: Goals as knowledge structures \n- Motivation and social behaviour: Sociobiology, evolutionary psychology. Cultural perspectives \n- Interaction between emotion and motivation", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351715070525896,-N351715070519897,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "6.

Christopher Cohrs", "Catalogue": "Spring > School of Humanities and Social Sciences > Psychology > Undergraduate Level Courses", "Official Course Description": "Generally speaking, an attitude is a distinct combination of feelings (affect), inclinations to act (behaviour), and beliefs (cognition). From a layperson's perspective, one might think that an attitude is a stable trait, constituting a person's personality: We know whom we love, we know what we like and this will not change that easily. Historically, this has been the point of view of early psychological research and theorizing. Social Psychological research challenged this notion by providing empirical evidence reflecting the fact that people do not read up their attitudes from an internal meter; rather, attitudes are malleable and flexible and very much dependent on the situation. Given that this is the case, the measurement of attitudes needs a scientific training. It is important to know the methods of how I can get a rather stable opinion from a person instead of a flexible utterance. On the other hand, this sensitivity to context makes it possible that attitudes can be changed. Thus, for example, undesired attitudes leading to unhealthy behaviour can be changed if one understands their nature. \nThis course covers the following specific aspects of attitude research: \n \n- Historical developments in attitude research \n- The concept of attitudes: Its cognitive, emotional and behavioural components. \n- The measurement of attitudes: Classic, explicit measures (e.g., questionnaire methods) and implicit measures (e.g., reaction time measures). \n- Situational influences on attitudes. \n- The attitude-behaviour relation: When does an attitude lead to correspondent behaviour? \n- Attitude change. \n- Applications concerning consumer behaviour, person perception, health psychology and personal development.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351715081149905,-N351715081160906,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "7.

For instance, we sometimes buy things which we do not really need or even do not want to buy just because we fall prey to a clever advertisement or a smart salesperson. We sometimes behave in certain ways only because others around us do the same thing. Understanding when and why such things happen is the goal of this seminar. \nSocial psychologists have considered three major categories of social influence: Conformity, compliance, and obedience. Conformity involves changing one's behaviour to match the responses or actions of others, to fit in with others around. Compliance refers to the act of changing one's behaviour in response to a direct request. Obedience is a special type of compliance that involves changing one's behaviour in response to a directive from an authority figure. \nThis seminar explores direct and indirect strategies of social influence. In particular, strategies that make use of the following principles will be discussed: \n \n- The norm of reciprocation: This rule says that people should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided them. \n- Commitment and consistency: Once they make a choice or take a stand, individuals will encounter personal and interpersonal pressure to behave consistently with that commitment. \n- Social proof: People tend to view a behaviour as correct in a given situation to the degree that they see others performing it. \n- Liking: People prefer to say yes to requests of others who they know and like. \n- Authority: People sometimes obey to authority figures and do things they would never have done without the influence of authorities. \n- Scarcity: Opportunities seem more valuable when they are less available, and are, therefore more likely taken. \n \nWhile this seminar primarily focuses on theoretical explanations and basic research findings in the field of social influence, the implications for various applied settings will be discussed. These include, for instance, advertisement design and consumer behaviour, negotiations in business and oratory techniques in law settings.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351715070581894,-N351715070543895,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "7.

During the past century, scholars have hotly debated how protest originates and spreads. Can grievance alone sustain prolonged protest? Which types of political systems facilitate or inhibit mobilization? How do activists recruit others to join their cause? These are a few of the many important questions we address in this course, particularly during the first section, when we read and discuss some of the seminal theoretical works of the field. In the second section, we examine the factors associated with social movement success or failure. Why are some movements able to initiate change, whereas other movements flounder and fail? How does government/social control shape outcomes? In the third section, we move beyond theory and analyze one of the most influential case studies in the field: the U.S. civil rights movement. At its zenith, the civil rights movement had several different \u0093wings.\u0094 We examine the ideologies and tactics of the various wings, the government\u0092s reactions, and the tensions within the broader movement. The readings include scholarly texts and works by notable civil rights leaders, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X.

They are thus examined with reference to historical precursors, comparable contemporary phenomena from other social science fields, and general social theory. Realism, institutionalism, constructivism, world systems theory and world society theory all refer back to well-known basic concepts, constructs, principles, or assumptions, and this course will show that a contextualization generates theoretical resources that can be used both to critically analyze the different paradigms and to compare them. This seminar builds on the previous seminar in this module area (Normative Theories of International Order) and on the introduction to the basic elements of theory offered in the first semester course \"Theories of Action and Institutions\".", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351715038798870,-N351715038722871,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "11.

In recent years it has been argued that profound transformations are taking place which challenge the very foundations of the externally and internally sovereign modern state.

It is intended as a one-semester course that combines selected topics from both the mandatory statistical methods courses for SHSS students (Statistical Methods I: Exploring Relationships and Comparing Groups and Statistical Methods II: Classification, Modelling and Prediction) to offer the more relevant topics for logistics and SES major students. The course will focus on the understanding of statistical concepts and the application of statistical techniques. While some formulae might be used, no stringent mathematical derivation will be provided. The general objective is to become an intelligent user of the various univariate and multivariate statistical techniques and to acquire the knowledge for deciding which procedure is most suitable for the given business situation. We will discuss the theoretical aspects of the statistical methods, discuss the assumptions for their use, reflect on their limitations and the controversies they create. In practical sessions we will learn how to run the particular procedures using SPSS and/or R, how to interpret the computer output and how to skillfully communicate the results of statistical analyses.", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351715000732840,-N351715000706841,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

For this course students obtain 1.6 credits toward the completion of the APS module. It is an introduction to the principles and procedures of scientific inquiry. It explains how learning at the high-school level differs from learning at university level, and how scientific research differs from everyday sense making. It gives students a broad overview of alternative research strategies and trains them in basic scientific work and learning skills, such as using the Jacobs University Information Resource Center, retrieving and organizing information, and citing correctly. All the topics are dedicated to step-by-step guidance for students in writing an academic paper: choosing a topic and research questions, finding and evaluating sources, structuring a logical argument and styling the paper academically, citing correctly, and avoiding plagiarism. All skills are immediately put into practice, as all students are required to write either an independent paper or a paper tailored to one of the subject-specific courses they are simultaneously taking. \n* If you're not sure whether APS is mandatory for you please check the handbook/mandatory tables of your respective major carefully!", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N352613814157896,-N352613814175897,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Appointments": [], "Course Name Abbreviation": "APS Man", "Type": "Seminar", "Name": "APS000 Academic skills in a nutshell: an introduction to writing an academic paper"}, {"Partial Grades": "Final Grade", "Min. | Max. participants": "- | 300", "Credits": "0.10", "CourseID": "999013", "This course is divided into the following sections": "Researching and Contacting your Future Employer (0,1 credits) - A Show small group \nLisa Verena Heindl\nWed, 12.
