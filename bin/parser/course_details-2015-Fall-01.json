        "Official Course Description": "The course is a seminar with a component of creativity and research workshops. The seminar addresses a major problem, and open question in transdisciplinary research, namely the relation and connection between visuals, their perception, reception, interpretation, but also their production, and empathy as a (not only) human capacity to connect to others, to identify, but also to distinguish oneself from others. There are strong indications from various disciplines – philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, biology, neuroscience, media and communication, art history as well as applied therapy and visual design that there is an intrinsic connection between the sense of seeing/vision, and an empathetic or apathetic reaction to these visuals. The course explores this connection and its consequences from transdisciplinary perspectives with the aim of developing transdisciplinary research projects in research teams in the area of “Visual Empathy”.",

The course will introduce concepts of free expression and its limits, comparing especially absolutist U. S. with qualified European models. \n \nA particularly interesting focus of this general problem is offensive, humorous free expression: “Calm down, it was just a joke for ‘God’s’ sake!” Three specific questions will frame the comedic dimension of the analysis: what is the nature and the role of humor, is there a comedic ethics and does humor legally mitigate or aggravate offensive expression? \n \nThe course will consider the nature, history, and cultural diversity of violent societal conflict. In particular, the course will consider evolving definitions of “war” and attempts by international organizations to create a binding framework – legal or at least ethical – for constraining war.",

        "Official Course Description": "B2.2 (1 and 2) is the second of three parts within the B2 level. \nThis course is designed as an advanced intermediate course for students who have completed B2.1 (2) or equivalent. \nCourse objectives are to further increase your proficiency in the four skills (speaking, reading, listening, writing), dealing with detailed, more complex texts covering a broad range of topics, including topics outside your own professional and personal interests. \nSpeaking: passing on detailed information accurately and comprehensively, expressing facts clearly and systematically, describing relatively complex processes. \nReading: understanding new facts and detailed information in texts, understanding articles/reports in which the writer adopts a specific stance or viewpoint. \nListening: following relatively long discussions on current affairs, understanding the main points of complex lectures, talks, and presentations. \nWriting: writing a summary of articles or reports on topics of general interest, writing about current affairs or abstract topics and expressing your thoughts and opinions. \nTopics will be: immigration, emigration, integration, non-verbal communication, conflict solutions, youth and violence, internet. \nConcerning forms and structures, the focus will be on positions in the sentence, negation, comparative sentences, the pronoun “es”, generalizing relative clauses, modal clauses (extension and expansion). \n \nYou can reach language level B2.2 within two semesters taking course B2.2 (1) and the continuation B2.2 (2) during the following semester. \nFor a detailed description of all language levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages check the Goethe website: \nhttp://www.goethe.de/z/50/commeuro/",

        "Official Course Description": "This course is designed for students with an advanced knowledge of German (courses of B2 level, “Goethe-Zertifikat B2” or equivalent). \n \nThe objective of this course is to further develop your ability in (a) speaking, (b) reading, (c) writing, and (d) listening. At the same time you will get more familiar with (e) German culture by reading/watching quite various text and film genres. You will also review and learn (f) (grammatical) forms and structures. \n \n(a) Speaking: You will learn how to express yourself flexibly, spontaneously and fluently, giving clear and detailed descriptions, to precisely express your thoughts and opinions thanks to a good command of a wide range of verbal modes of expression. You will practice your speaking in class and during (panel) discussions and by giving short presentations. \n \n(b) Listening: You will learn how to follow extended speech, group discussions and debates on various, also non-familiar topics. The listening assignments will exclusively be based on authentic German texts and films. \n \n(c) Reading: You will learn how to understand longer and demanding texts, including journalistic, academic and literary texts. \n \n(d) Writing: You will learn how to write clear, well-structured texts on complex subjects with considerable accuracy. You will practice coherent writing using organizational patterns such as cohesive devices. To intensify the writing process we will establish a course blog. \n \n(e) Culture: The course will have a focus on film, i.e. you will watch short films, news shows, documentaries, commercials and a feature film (literary adaptation) that will especially exercise your listening abilities. At the same time you will learn about German culture or topics that are currently discussed in Germany. \n \n(f) Grammatical structures will be brushed up if necessary, but you will also learn new and more subtle structures such as modal particles, different phrasing (e.g. nominal style), and various and complex forms of attribution. \n \nAfter completing the level C1 successfully, you can take the corresponding Goethe language examination “Goethe Zertifikat C1” at the Goethe Institute in Bremen. Please check the website \n \nfor details on the examination “Goethe Zertifikat C1”: \nhttp://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/bes/gc1/enindex.htm \n \nfor details on times and fees: \nhttp://www.goethe.de/ins/de/ort/bre/prf/zc1/deindex.htm \n \n \n \nFor a detailed description of all language levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages check the Goethe website: \n \nhttp://www.goethe.de/z/50/commeuro/ \n \n \nTextbook: No general textbook, material will be provided",

At the end of the B2 level, students should be able to have a normal conversation with a native speaker, present their opinions and develop an argumentation on a wide range of topics. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to, for example, understand and express your opinion on a TV or radio interview, comment a press article on social phenomenon, write a movie synopsis.",

We will work on press articles, abstract of novels or films on a variety of topics such as shared apartments, music festivals and university or work environment in Spain and Latin America. At the end of the B1 level, students should be able to cope with most of the situations one might be faced to on a trip in a country where Spanish is spoken. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to, for example, describe your academic background to a future employer (use of past tenses), give your point of view and debate on a variety of subjects (different ways of expressing consequences, aims…) or help you to understand the main points of a radio or a TV broadcast. Also we will read a short novel. And we might go to watch a movie. \nStudents attending these courses can reach language level B1 (according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). Furthermore, after a successful completion of these courses, you can take the corresponding DELE B1 examination at the Instituto Cervantes in Bremen.

        "Official Course Description": "B1.1 and B1.2: \n \nThese courses are designed for students with an intermediate knowledge of Spanish (A2.2 class or equivalent). \nIn class, we will work on five competences: oral - writing production and oral - written comprehension and interaction. The aim is to provide a view on the Spanish and the Latin American cultures, discuss it and compare it with the students’ cultural backgrounds. We will work on press articles, abstract of novels or films on a variety of topics such as shared apartments, music festivals and university or work environment in Spain and Latin America. At the end of the B1 level, students should be able to cope with most of the situations one might be faced to on a trip in a country where Spanish is spoken. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to, for example, describe your academic background to a future employer (use of past tenses), give your point of view and debate on a variety of subjects (different ways of expressing consequences, aims…) or help you to understand the main points of a radio or a TV broadcast. Also we will read a short novel. And we might go to watch a movie. \nStudents attending these courses can reach language level B1 (according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). Furthermore, after a successful completion of these courses, you can take the corresponding DELE B1 examination at the Instituto Cervantes in Bremen. Please check the website for details on the examination: \n \nhttp://diplomas.cervantes.es/informacion/niveles/nivel_b1.html or \nhttp://nivelesb.diplomas.cervantes.es/b1.htm",

        "Official Course Description": "Unlike other engineering disciplines, the complete theory of electrical engineering can be summarized in four fundamental equations known as Maxwell's equations. This course gives an introduction to electric and magnetic field theory, leading to Maxwell's equations. In addition, the theory is applied to wave propagation problems and guided waves on transmission lines. This knowledge enables us to understand the physics behind electrical signals travelling through lines and electronic devices. \nContents \nElectric Field: Electric charge, charge distributions, Coulomb's law, electric field, dipoles, electric flux, Gauss' law, potential, capacitance, \nCurrents: current density, conductance, superconductors, semiconductors, \n \nMagnetic Fields: magnetic force, magnetic flux, Ampere's law, inductance, Faraday's law, Lenz' law, displacement current, boundary conditions, \n \nElectromagnetic Waves: Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic waves, radiation \n \nGuided Waves: waves on transmission lines, wave reflection, standing waves, line parameters, Smith chart, cascaded two-port networks.",

The lab course is offered in conjunction with the course on Signals and Systems (300201). The concepts of signals and systems are generic and applications can be found in several areas like communications, speech and image processing, or process control. The goal of the lab is to apply these concepts by a combined approach of experiments and simulations. The experiments will provide the students with practical experience and allow the students to relate the experiments to signals and systems theory. \nTopics: \nStep response of RLC circuits, filters (RLC circuits), fourier transform and fourier series, sampling, digital filters, modulation, control experiment.",

        "Official Course Description": "Dynamical systems in nature and technology often behave in a counterintuitive \nfashion and are thus difficult to predict and to regulate. The counter-intuitive behavior \ncomes from nonlinear interactions between the system components and the nonlinear processing \nof incoming information. This course is an introduction to nonlinear dynamics and control \nwith a focus on a broad range of applications. Topics include: \n1. Low dimensional autonomous dynamical systems: formulation as differential equation, \nflow, fixed points, stability, stability criteria, potentials and Lyapunov functionals, simple local \nbifurcations (saddle-node, pitchfork, transcritical, cusp, Hopf), simple numerical schemes, \ntime-discrete maps (fixed points, stability), introduction to chaos. \n2. Control for linear systems: general matrix-based solution for driven linear ODEs, reachability, \ncontrollability, observability, Gram-matrix for determining control laws and for reconstruction, \nlinear-state feedback controller, stable-state estimation, introduction to optimal control. \n3. Reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (activator-inhibitor, relations to control), \nstability of stationary solutions, Turing instability.",

This shows that this is an emerging field. It builds on radio engineering, digital communications, computer networks and protocols, distributed systems, information management, and applications. Most of these topics are taught in other specialization courses mainly within this major, but also within other majors. This course will equip students with the basic knowledge in wireless communications and radio system engineering. It will make the physical limitations of communications technologies understandable to the computer scientist, while making the system architecture and technology accessible to the electrical engineer.",

        "Official Course Description": "Information theory serves as the most important foundation for communication \nsystems. The course provides an analytical framework for modeling and evaluating \npoint-to-point and multi-point communication. \nAfter a short rehearsal of probability and random variables and some excursion to random \nnumber generation, the key concept of information content of a signal source and information \ncapacity of a transmission medium are precisely defined, and their relationships to data compression \nalgorithms and error control codes are examined in detail. The course aims to install \nan appreciation for the fundamental capabilities and limitations of information transmission \nschemes and to provide the mathematical tools for applying these ideas to a broad class of \ncommunications systems. \nAside from source and channel aspects, an introduction to security is given, including publickey \ncryptography. \nInformation theory is standard in every communications-oriented Bachelor’s program.",

        "Official Course Description": "As the feature size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink at a staggering rate, the increasing degree of integration allows very complex digital systems to be realized on a single chip. Such systems can either be fabricated in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) using very high scale integration (VLSI) techniques or implemented in programmable devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In both cases, very large designs are partitioned into a hierarchy of logical blocks, and by adhering to a set of standard design rules, the difficulty of integrating these blocks is dramatically reduced. The most popular approach is synchronous design with register transfer level (RTL) logic, but asynchronous designs are also possible. \n \nAlthough digital systems were traditionally designed at the schematic level, the current trend is towards hardware description languages (HDLs) that allow compact description of very complex hardware constructs. The appearance of sophisticated automatic hardware synthesis engines that implement logic directly from HDL have made HDLs the choice for new logic designs. Although the target language of this class is VHDL, other languages such as Verilog and SystemC apply the same design strategies. This course stresses the importance of viewing HDL as a way of describing real hardware, and not \"just another programming language\".",

        "Official Course Description": "The course provides a foundation in the theory and methods of digital image processing with applications in medical imaging. We start with morphological image processing, which is one of the most powerful tool sets in dealing with digital images and it is the backbone of many of today's high-performance image analysis systems. After basic concepts of image-to-image transformations, morphological and Fourier filtering, and the watershed transform, we develop into advanced strategies for image segmentation, image registration, and pattern recognition. Not least, we concentrate on solving problems from diagnostic and therapeutic medical imaging, and will provide an overview of the broader field of medical image analysis. The course also addresses practical implementation aspects of specific image processing tasks. To this end, knowledge in C or C++ will be required.",

        "Official Course Description": "Machine learning (ML) is all about algorithms which are fed with (large quantities of) real-world data, and which return a compressed ``model'' of the data. An example is the ``world model'' of a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its environment -- needed, for instance, for navigation. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings, from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech recognition systems. There is a large number of formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally large diversity of learning algorithms. However, there is a relatively small number of fundamental challenges which are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms: most notably, the ``curse of dimensionality'' and the almost deadly-dangerous problem of under- vs.\\ overfitting. This lecture introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, mixtures of Gaussians, Parzen windows). Furthermore, the course also provides an intense refresher of the requisite concepts from probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.",

We will introduce \nthe syntax and semantics of first-order logic, and discuss calculi, soundness, completeness \non this system. We will cover machine-oriented inference calculi like analytic tableaux, and \nresolution and apply them to theorem proving and logic programming applications. \nWe will discuss the non-deductive reasoning modes of abduction and induction and briefly \nintroduce computational methods for mechanizing them. Finally, we will give an introduction \nto knowledge representation and description logics, leading to an introduction of \"semantic \nweb\" techniques.",

        "Official Course Description": "As the feature size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink at a staggering rate, the increasing degree of integration allows very complex digital systems to be realized on a single chip. Such systems can either be fabricated in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) using very high scale integration (VLSI) techniques or implemented in programmable devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In both cases, very large designs are partitioned into a hierarchy of logical blocks, and by adhering to a set of standard design rules, the difficulty of integrating these blocks is dramatically reduced. The most popular approach is synchronous design with register transfer level (RTL) logic, but asynchronous designs are also possible. \n \nAlthough digital systems were traditionally designed at the schematic level, the current trend is towards hardware description languages (HDLs) that allow compact description of very complex hardware constructs. The appearance of sophisticated automatic hardware synthesis engines that implement logic directly from HDL have made HDLs the choice for new logic designs. Although the target language of this class is VHDL, other languages such as Verilog and SystemC apply the same design strategies. This course stresses the importance of viewing HDL as a way of describing real hardware, and not \"just another programming language\".",

        "Official Course Description": "Model-order reduction methods explore ways in which the complexity of the mathematical models of physical systems can be reduced for the purposes of expedient, yet accurate, computer-aided analysis. Recently, these methods are being pursued by the electromagnetics and circuits computer-aided design (CAD) communities in their efforts to develop efficient modeling tools capable of tackling the escalating complexity of the design and virtual prototyping of integrated mixed-signal systems. \nThis course offers a comprehensive view of the development and application of model-order reduction methods in the analysis and CAD of complex circuits and systems. \n \nIn particular, the first half of the course will be dedicated to the fundamentals of linear dynamical systems, their representation both in state space and input-output terms, and their approximation. \nThe methods developed will then be applied to model-order reduction for large linear circuits arising in modeling the interconnection networks in high-density integrated circuits. Applications include the reduction of both lumped RLC and transmission-line-based circuit models. \n \nThe course is based on the book: \"Approximation of large-scale systems\", by A.C. Antoulas, published by SIAM, Philadelphia, 2005.",

        "Official Course Description": "Typically, an antenna is the interface between the transceiver frontend and the free space. Antennas are used in many different applications, where mobile communication is only one, although, one of the most important ones. In many cases it is the antenna that causes some trouble (dysfunction, disconnection, etc.) if not properly designed and realized (maybe you remember the trouble with Apple's iPhone 4 antenna in 2010). Therefore, engineers who are working in the wireless business have to know about the working principles of antennas. \nThe course is organized as follows. After an introduction (chapter 1) we will recapitulate the Maxwell's Equations (chapter 2) and the basics of electromagnetic waves and their main characteristics. \nThese topics are foundational for understanding antenna theory. In chapter 4 the basic method for dealing with antenna problems is introduced which is the method of vector potentials calculated by a given antenna current that causes radiation in the transmit mode (or that is induced if the antenna is receiving). The Hertzian dipole and the electrically small loop antenna (i.e., a magnetic \ndipole) are calculated as the very first and very basic antennas. After that, the most important terms and definitions are introduced, i.e., radiation characteristic (beam pattern), directivity, gain, efficiency, path loss, half power beamwidth, and EIRP. In chapter 5 we calculate linear antennas, here, dipole antennas of different electrical lengths. Chapter 6 is devoted to array antennas and the calculation of the array factor. Exemplarily, different array configurations consisting of half-wavelength dipoles are considered. This deepens the understanding of how beamforming, nulling, etc. \ncan be realized by so called phased array antennas. \nIn chapter 7 aperture antennas are discussed. For that, the method of equivalent sources is introduced. This theory is then applied to horn antennas and slot antennas followed by parabolic reflector antennas and lens antennas. \nFinally, microstrip patch antennas and patch antenna arrays are investigated.",

        "Official Course Description": "Machine learning (ML) is all about algorithms which are fed with (large quantities of) real-world data, and which return a compressed ``model'' of the data. An example is the ``world model'' of a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its environment -- needed, for instance, for navigation. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings, from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech recognition systems. There is a large number of formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally large diversity of learning algorithms. However, there is a relatively small number of fundamental challenges which are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms: most notably, the ``curse of dimensionality'' and the almost deadly-dangerous problem of under- vs.\\ overfitting. This lecture introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, mixtures of Gaussians, Parzen windows). Furthermore, the course also provides an intense refresher of the requisite concepts from probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.",

We will introduce \nthe syntax and semantics of first-order logic, and discuss calculi, soundness, completeness \non this system. We will cover machine-oriented inference calculi like analytic tableaux, and \nresolution and apply them to theorem proving and logic programming applications. \nWe will discuss the non-deductive reasoning modes of abduction and induction and briefly \nintroduce computational methods for mechanizing them. Finally, we will give an introduction \nto knowledge representation and description logics, leading to an introduction of \"semantic \nweb\" techniques.",

Biological (e.g. genetic) and contextual (e.g. experience) influences on brain development over the lifespan are addressed. Plasticity of the brain across the lifespan is emphasized. Plasticity is the ability of the nervous system to respond to changed demands and, thus, underlies learning and adaptive behavior. Development of the cerebral cortex and behavioral outcomes are explored in the context of environmental effects that can amplify or inhibit adaptive capacity. Neural malleability is maximal in early development, but the capacity for change in the nervous system is maintained throughout life including old age. Normal age development of the brain is contrasted to pathological changes that appear in some diseases of old age. Consequences of normal and non-normal development and aging and the influence of lifestyle factors (e.g., a physically active lifestyle, continued education) are discussed. Students will leave the course with an understanding of brain-behavior-environment interactions in lifespan developmental outcomes. Students will train their research, presentation and writing skills by critically evaluating scientific evidence.",

        "Official Course Description": "This lab course intends to intensely train students in laboratory practice on a given research project of the Instructor's group. It is an integrated part of the lab rotations each student has to attend during the 3rd year education. Two lab rotations per each semesterof the 3rd year will give the students the opportunity to visit four different research laboratories of the various life sciences disciplines participating (see above for a list of participating PI's) in this course structure. All individual lab rotations will finally be written up in a thesis to prove the student's ability of performing independent research. Scheduling has to be decided between the Students and the individual Instructors of the particular lab rotations. The Instructors of Record of the BC+CB, Bio, BI+CB, and BCE 3rd year lab courses I and II will have to organize for accommodation of each student within the research laboratories preferably of their first choices. However, this needs to be done in a way to allow equal and appropriate distribution of all students between the various research groups. Students will indicate their preferences, and the Instructors of Record will decide on the order of lab rotations during the 3rd year. To enable the students with the necessary information on which lab to choose, an information evening will be organized at the end of the 4th semester. Students are urged to attend.",

In the first part the structures, dynamics and chemistry of important biomolecules will be described. The thermodynamics and kinetics of ligand binding to proteins and enzyme catalysis will be explained and enzymatic catalysis explored at the molecular and atomic level. The second part focuses on metabolism and describes how energy is produced by living organisms and how the molecules of life are synthesised and degraded. A special focus will be set on common principles and the integration of the metabolism. The third part of the course explains how the genetic information stored in the DNA sequence is maintained and expressed. In addition the mechanism of DNA binding and modification by proteins and enzymes will be presented. The techniques of modern molecular biology will be described and the results of the human genome project discussed.",

        "Official Course Description": "This course intends to give a detailed understanding on the biology of pro- and eukaryotic cells on the basis of the biochemistry of the structure and function of cellular macromolecules (see Adv BC\\ I). Cells are limited by a plasma membrane bearing important functions like communication of cells with their surroundings. Within eukaryotic cells, biological membranes form cellular compartments to optimize biochemical reactions necessary for all cells to perform their biological functions. The biogenesis of cellular compartments will be a central part on the way of understanding the evolution of multicellular organisms. The complexity of cellular systems and of their macromolecular constituents becomes most obvious in certain dysorders which have been characterized on the molecular level. Therefore, biomedical implications will be included whereever possible.",

Besides a detailed view into general microbiology and microbial ecology, the course deals with molecular aspects of evolution, microbiology, and plant cell biology and physiology. Therefore, special emphasis will be given to environmental, microbial, and \"green\" biology. This includes exciting insights into molecular aspects of the interactions between living organisms, such as symbiosis, infectious diseases, and global element cycles. While three modules within the fall semester will cover the fields of Molecular Evolution, General Microbiology (incl. bacteria, protists, and fungi), and Microbial Ecology (incl. element cycles, symbiosis, and pathology), the three modules of the spring \nsemester will bring insights into Molecular Biology of Plant Cells, Plant Eco-physiology, and Plant and Microbial Genetics. Additionally, all modules will highlight how we can explore our knowledge of microbial and plant molecular biology at the level of biotechnology.",

One lab rotation in each semester of the 3rd year will give the students the opportunity to work in a research laboratory of one of the various life sciences disciplines participating (see list of instructors). Both lab rotations will be written up in a thesis to prove the student's ability of performing guided research. Scheduling has to be decided between the students and the individual instructors of the particular lab rotations. The Instructor of Record will have to organize accommodation of the students within the research laboratories preferably of their first choices. However, this needs to be done in a way allowing equal and appropriate distribution of all students between the various research groups. To provide information about the research topics and how the course will be conducted, a meeting with the instructors will be organized at the end of the 4th semester. It is strongly recommended that all prospective 3rd year BCCB-students attend this information session.",

The second part focuses on metabolism and describes how energy is produced by living organisms and how the molecules of life are synthesised and degraded. A special focus will be set on common principles and the integration of the metabolism. The third part of the course explains how the genetic information stored in the DNA sequence is maintained and expressed. In addition the mechanism of DNA binding and modification by proteins and enzymes will be presented.

        "Official Course Description": "One of the most challenging tasks in modern science is to design the optimal experimental strategy to unravel the fascinating complexity of biological systems. On one hand, this strategy may involve the isolation and characterization of a single macromolecule, on the other hand it could require the genetic manipulation and functional analysis of a whole organism. This course provides a problem-oriented introduction to important experimental methods employed in modern Molecular Life Sciences. The participants will learn about advantages and limitations of a broad spectrum of different techniques in biochemistry, molecular biology and cell biology. Research Strategies will be developed based on both, solving fictitious problems in theory and by analyzing current scientific literature. At the end of the course, students will write their own research proposal to analyze a given scientific problem.",

An important task of bioinformatics is to put data into a larger context by identifying statistical similarities between the data. Finding genes in DNA sequences, identifying common structural features in (evolutionarily) related protein sequences and extracting functional properties from the architecture of cellular networks are examples of this general strategy of bioinformatics, which will be highlighted throughout the course. \n \nMajor topics will be: \n- Biological data, acquisition and storage \n- Similarity and Alignment \n- Pairwise and Multiple Sequence comparisons \n- Sequence patterns and motifs \n- Genome analysis \n- Genome signatures \n- Hidden Markov models \n- Networks",

        "Official Course Description": "Part 1: Sequence analysis. The increasing amount of biological data in particular \nof protein and DNA sequences requires students to gain practical experience with algorithms \nand computational tools for sequence analysis. The lab course intends to train students in \nthe application of computational approaches to nucleic acid and protein sequence analysis and \nsecondary structure prediction. The script language Perl will be introduced and students will \nbe trained to write own applications and to program bioinformatics algorithms and methods. It \nwill give a practical introduction and an overview on available and frequently applied sequence \nanalysis methods including the software to align and compare sequences and to predict coding \nand non-coding regions. Multiple alignment methods will be used to align several sequences \nand to identify conserved elements. In addition, computational methods for the prediction of \nprotein and RNA secondary structure will be introduced and applied to selected examples. The \ngeneration of a SQL data base in combination with a script language will be introduced. \nPart 2: Genomics. In the second part of the lab course (Genomics) hands on in genome \nanalysis will be obtained. Starting with a students seminar on a special topic related to genome \nresearch every week, several tools will be tested and used for sequence analysis. We will use \nweb-bases systems as well as standalone tools installed on a local server. Complete genomes as \nwell as genomic fragments will be analysed. The genomic fragments will serve as the template \nfor in depth annotation using an open source annotation system (GenDB). A local installation \nof the phylogenetic software package ARB will be used for phylogenetic inference and tree \nreconstruction of selected functional genes.",

Starting with an in depth understanding of genetic engineering and laboratory evolution methods, the students follow the path of the gene from cultivation through product formation to product recovery. \nThe first part of the practical lab course includes genetic engineering of microbial DNA (directed evolution) and subsequently introducing the mutated genes into microorganisms via transformation. \nThe second part of the practical course involves cultivation of microorganisms in laboratory scale as well as in production scale (fermentation). Our students will learn methods of concentrating the cell mass and applying different methods to recover a product suitable for subsequent processing (e.g. high pressure homogenizer). The third part of the practical course includes the purification of proteins by chromatography.",

        "Official Course Description": "High throughput screening (HTS) is a tool in the discovery of pharmaceutical, chemical, and agricultural compounds. HTS is a main selective tool in big-scale research programs like drug discovery. Methods of HTS are basically methods of analytical biochemistry (photometry, purification, electrophoresis, kinetic assay, radioisotopes, immunoassay, descriptive statistics, regression analysis, etc), that is why HTS course explicitly covers these subjects, because firm knowledge of methods of analytical biochemistry is crucially important for assay design, its validation, and following data analysis and decision making. During the course we also will learn principles of the various detection techniques (light absorption, fluorescence, readioisotope technique). Consequently, the pivot part of the HTS is assay design, where detection techniques are one of the essential parts, and following statistical treatment of the results will lead to making of the decision. Also we will learn physical principles and operational basics of many analytical biochemical instruments used for multi-sample analysis (microplate readers, scintillation counters) as well as consumables for the HTS. In this course we will cover state of the art technologies including automated liquid handling machines (robots) and techniques used in HTS. A focus will be on genetic engineering techniques and screening systems involved. Additionally required automation and engineering approaches will be covered in detail. The goal is to \nprovide students with a background that enables them to successfully implement HTS strategies in real world applications of high-tech industry by mining the created diversity and finding the needle in haystack.",

It is an integrated part of the lab rotations each student has to attend during the 3rd year education. Two lab rotations per each semester of the 3rd year will give the students the opportunity to visit two to four different research laboratories of the various life sciences disciplines participating in this course structure. All individual lab rotations will finally be written up in a thesis to prove the students ability of performing independent research. Scheduling has to be decided between students and the individual instructor of the particular lab rotations.",

        "Official Course Description": "Environmental Biotechnology is also known as Grey Biotechnology. It is the fundamental basis of applied biotechnology when it is applied to and used to study processes in the natural environment. Environmental Biotechnology could also imply that one try to harness biological process for commercial uses and exploitation. The growing concern over the quality of our environment demands prevention of polluting releases in the ecosystem and treatment of pollutants already there. The lecture course will deal with aerobic and anaerobic treatment of waste water. The most important part a waste-water cleaning plant is the biological part. During several hours of stay a considerable part of the pollution is removed by bacteria and the BOD5 (biological oxygen demand) is reduced by 85 to 95% during the waste-water treatment. Modern waste-water treatment plants do a good job for the removal of the organic matter. The problem nowadays is the removal of nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate) and phosphate from waste-water. The essential processes are nitrification (i.e. oxidation of ammonia to nitrate) and denitrification (i.e. the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen). These processes cannot proceed at the same time or in the same place because nitrification needs high oxygen concentration (oxygen concentration above 2mg/l) whereas denitrification needs anaerobic condition (oxygen concentration lower than 0.1 mg/l). All the different aerobic and anaerobic biological processes that are involved in the elimination of organic pollution from waste water and soil will be discussed in the course.",

        "Official Course Description": "Interactions between molecules, such as antibody-antigen, enzyme-substrates, receptor-membrane are the base of biological processes. This course introduces current theoretical and experimental tools to quantify such interaction between biomolecules. We begin with a molecular view to introduce the relevant forces and interaction necessary to understand and perform molecular modeling. In a second part we follow a more macroscopic thermodynamic view: substrate binding or partitioning, cooperative effects, transport across membranes to name a few keywords. The third part is devoted to kinetic phenomena and the necessary experimental techniques as relaxation theory, correlation spectroscopy, stopped flow.",

New avenues for research are discussed. Presentations of research from the Hammann group may be added as appropriate. \nThe courses are suitable for graduate students in the MoLife MSc program who have strong background in biochemistry and-or molecular genetics (e.g. those in the specialization area Molecular Genetics) and also for final year undergraduates from the BCCB major. \nThe students who attend the courses present papers, possibly several times during the semester, upon which grading is based. Individual presentation training is provided. \nThe two courses take place in alternating semesters, LCRB I in the fall and LCRB II in the spring. Both courses can be taken independently or in addition to one another. No course is a prerequisite for the other, since the literature sources discussed in the two courses are independent of each other.",

The students will learn the theory of variable tools used to design these microbes in order to exploit them for human life as well as methods to analyse the introduced changes of the metabolic networks. An overview about the principles of microbial engineering, i.e. the integration of engineering methods, analysis approaches and metabolic modeling will be given. The course also provides knowledge concerning approaches for global analysis (omics fluxomics). Topics such as evolutionary engineering and selection of microorganisms, next generation sequencing and genomic mapping will also be included. Examples for successful engineering strategies from the current literature will be discussed.",

Starting from the level of a single operon (i.e. a sequence of genes under joint regulation) and ending with large-scale transcriptional regulatory networks we will discuss (and describe with mathematical models) how genes regulate other genes. \nUsing the mathematical models, we will try to connect different levels of dynamical behavior in gene regulation with laboratory data. \nTopics include: recent models of the lac operon; noise in gene expression; statistical properties, evolution and interference of gene regulatory networks; role of DNA topology; robustness of gene regulation; modeling of RNA interference. \nThe material will mostly be recent scientific literature. Grading will be based on seminar presentations and on active participation in the discussions.",

        "Official Course Description": "Theoretical Biology is the mathematical modeling of biological processes with the goal of capturing the essence of a biological phenomenon, rather than constructing a one-to-one ”in silico” copy of the biological system in the computer. It has a long tradition at the interface of mathematics and biology. \n \nIn this course we will discuss some prominent modeling case studies, ranging from simple \nmodels of population dynamics to intracellular calcium signaling, models of the biological \nclock, cell cycle models and models of gene regulation. \n \nThroughout the course we will introduce and employ a wide variety of mathematical formalisms \nand modeling strategies: ordinary differential equations, cellular automata, partial \ndifferential equations, Boolean models and stochastic models. \n \nThe goal of the course is to convey the key principles of how to cast biological knowledge \ninto a mathematical form. At the same time we want to illustrate the diversity of mathematical \nmodeling approaches and the rich history of this field of Theoretical Biology.",

        "Official Course Description": "Course Description - Overview \nMaking effective decisions about challenges or problems in the Management or Engineering sectors often requires the ability to define the true problem, analyze the possible causes, create options, select the most feasible option, and then implement it. This course will help professionals enhance their efforts to find sustainable solutions and learn how to make more effective managerial and engineering decisions via a logical problem-solving approach. We will initially look at some thoretical frameworks and then examine how uncertainty and ambiguity may impact managerial perceptions of choices and risks, and also the role that interpersonal skills plays in convincing colleagues or employees about decisions. A number of real-life decision-making examples will be presented as case studies and used as practical exercises. Within the context of the SCEM MSc program, this course contributes to vital modern leadership and management competencies. \n \n \nAims of Course \n• Better understand the decision making process and its pitfalls \n• Become a more rational decision maker \n• Adapt a more efficient decision making approach to optimize your managerial style \n• Understand and incorporate cultural differences in decision making \n• Develop modern leadership and management competencies \n \nSpecific Learning Outcomes/ Course Objectives \n \nBy the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of organizational decision making and be able to form both an integrated and creative line of thinking in dealing with managerial and process decision making, some of which may be in cross-cultural or crisis situations. \n• Increase awareness about decision-making (including problem-solving steps, problem-solving tools, and creative thinking). \n• Review some theoretical methods in approaching decision-making \n• Distinguish the root cause of a given problem from the symptoms, in order to inform the best decision. \n• Develop a more insightful and critical attitude toward decision making; understand human factors that influence rational thinking. \n• Develop the necessary skills to participate in and communicate about a collaborative decision making process. \n• Identify leadership styles and develop their own approach. \nExamine some specific case studies and learn to recognize the pitfalls.",

This course shows how complex logistics systems can be modelled as discrete-event systems, gives an introduction into the theory of discrete event system simulation, and shows how to analyze the output of a simulation study. \nIn its associated lab course students will learn how to develop and conduct simulation experiments to analyze the behavior of discrete-event systems. \n \nThe main intended learning outcomes are to understand that: \n- (discrete event) simulation is an important method to design and optimize production and logistic processes; \n- it is widely used in industries, e.g. automobile industry; \n- simulation supports typical engineering work and gives better understanding of the system and processes. \n \nAt the end of this course students \n- will understand the nature of simulation: systems, models and simulation. \n- know about the difference between continuously and discrete modelling and simulation. \n- will understand under what conditions simulation can be applied. \n- are able to analyze the outputs: statistics, significance etc. \n- will be able to use simulation methods for optimization. \n- will be able to understand and analysis simulation studies (performed by others) and their outcome. \n \nProposed Content & Format \nThe course is based on regular lectures, combined with class room discussions to provide a solid basis of knowledge. In its corresponding lab course, students will apply this knowledge themselves.",

During this internship, students experience practical situations beyond their theoretical studies. They apply academic concepts in practice and have the chance to explore possible future opportunities for employment. Moreover, they work on these problems in dedicated teams. They learn how to split up tasks, how to work together, and how to behave and communicate in a professional context in order to take on the necessary steps. The GIP takes place off campus, normally between the second and the third semester of study and lasts at least two consecutive months.",

We introduce the dual vector space and dual linear maps and their relation \nwith bilinear forms. Classifications are given of symmetric and skew-symmetric real bilinear \nforms and of Hermitian and skew-Hermitian forms over the complex numbers. \nThe last part is concerned with tensors — objects that play an important role in many \nbranches of physics and mathematics. The tensor product of two (or more) vector spaces is \nintroduced and properties are discussed including the universal property, contraction of tensors, \n‘outer’ and ‘inner’ products, and the relationship between linear maps and tensors.",

        "Official Course Description": "Real Analysis is one of the core advanced courses in the Mathematics curriculum. \nIt introduces measures, integration, elements from functional analysis, and the theory \nof function spaces. Knowledge of these topics, especially Lebesgue integration, is instrumental \nin many areas, in particular, for stochastic processes, partial differential equations, applied and \nharmonic analysis, and is a prerequisite for the graduate course in Functional Analysis. \nThe course is suitable for undergraduate students who have taken Analysis I/II, and Linear \nAlgebra I; it should also be taken by incoming students of the Graduate Program in the Mathematical \nSciences. Due to the central role of integration in the applied sciences, this course \nprovides an excellent foundation for mathematically advanced students from physics and engineering",

Each participant must find a member of the faculty as a supervisor, and arrange to work with him or her in a small study group or on a one-on-one basis. \n \nGuided research has three major components: Literature study, research project, and seminar presentation. The relative weight of each will vary according to topic area, the level of preparedness of the participant(s), and the number of students in the study group. Possible research tasks include formulating and proving a conjecture, proving a known theorem in a novel way, investigating a mathematical problem by computer experiments, or studying a problem of practical importance using mathematical methods. \n \nThird year students in Mathematics and Computational Science are advised to take two semesters of Guided Research. The Guided Research report in the spring semester will typically be the Bachelor's Thesis which is a graduation requirement for every IUB undergraduate. Note that the Bachelor's Thesis may also be written as part of any other course by arrangement with the respective instructor of record.",

Each \nparticipant must find a member of the faculty as a supervisor, and arrange to work with him or \nher in a small study group or on a one-on-one basis. \nGuided research has three major components: Literature study, research project, and seminar \npresentation. The relative weight of each will vary according to topic area, the level of \npreparedness of the participant(s), and the number of students in the study group. Possible research \ntasks include formulating and proving a conjecture, proving a known theorem in a novel \nway, investigating a mathematical problem by computer experiments, or studying a problem of \npractical importance using mathematical methods. \nThird year students in Mathematics and ACM may take two semesters of Guided Research. \nThe Guided Research report in the spring semester will typically be the Bachelor Thesis which \nis a graduation requirement for every undergraduate. Note that the Bachelor Thesis may also \nbe written as part of any other course by arrangement with the respective instructor of record",

        "Official Course Description": "How can wide-scale social, economic and political change be achieved? In this course, we explore this question in the context of encouraging sustainability. To address global warming and environmental degradation, humans must adopt more sustainable lifestyles and switch from fossil fuel to low-carbon energy sources. Almost all countries, regions, companies and individuals must alter how they source and use energy. The main challenge to achieving this energy transition stems from human behavior and not from a lack of technology or scientific know-how. This course thus examines the transition from the perspective of the social sciences, including political science, sociology, psychology, economics and management. Some of the key questions the course addresses are: What is meant by sustainability? Are renewable energies sustainable? How can a change to sustainable energies be encouraged? What are the challenges? The aim of the course is to prepare students to critically assess sustainable energy policies from multiple perspectives.",

Securing access to low-cost and reliable sources of energy while at the same time maintaining environmental stewardship are among the most pressing challenges of our age. The aim of this course is to introduce students to economic theories and analytical frameworks for analyzing these issues. The course will begin by covering the economics of energy supply, focusing on both renewable and non-renewable energy sources. On the demand side, the course will distinguish between energy use in the residential, industrial and transportation sectors. Finally, the course will address the functioning of energy markets and market design. This will include discussions on the international oil market, the markets for natural gas, developments in the coal market, and the economics of energy-environment interactions. The course will regularly draw on case studies to illustrate the theoretical concepts.",

        "Official Course Description": "This course will present an overview of major ecological concepts from a rather new and unusual perspective: a process-based perspective. The fundamental processes analysed and discussed in this course are chosen according to their relevance to a planet with carbon-based life that persists over geological timescales. Such processes are: energy flow, multiple guilds, ecological tradeoffs and biodiversity, ecological hypercycles, merging of organismal and ecological physiology, carbon sequestration and photosynthesis. Nutrient cycling will be described as an emergent property of these fundamental processes. Fascinating aspects such as the reasons why a biosphere based on a single species with no nutrient cycling is very unlikely to exist or the possibility that feedbacks between organisms and their environment have helped to maintain habitable conditions on Earth will be explored. By studying the fundamental processes governing the ecology of our planet one can gain a deep understanding of its functioning from an Earth system perspective. The ideas and concepts discussed during the course will be formulated in the context of biology, ecosystem services and conservation biology. \nA module (8 academic hours) on computational ecology will be part of this course. \n \nModule on Computational Ecology \nThe module on computational ecology will consist of brief theoretical lectures and specific laboratory exercises to introduce the students to exponential, logistic, and nutrient-limited growth models. Moreover, a simple Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) model will be presented and a number of exercises will be analysed with the students to explore the importance of life on a planet, a \"Daisywork\" model will be introduced. With computer simulations, students will investigate the conditions under which biology regulates fundamental processes on a planet. \nRecommended would be also a computer lab course on some basic programming although a crash-course in the programming language python will be provided with this module.",

Soil development determines the functioning of soils as ecosystem compartments. Following this conceptual model, the course will start with the processes of soil development and the effect of different soil forming factors on soil formation. \nThe distribution of soil units on a global scale will be shown. Then we will educe soil properties and ecological functioning of soils from soil development. Interactions between soils and other ecosystem compartments (hydrosphere, biosphere) will be clarified. Finally the use of soils and human impact on soils will be addressed.",

        "Official Course Description": "This second-year laboratory course occupies in total two afternoons each week. The course accompanies the physics lectures and therefore, a close relationship between laboratory and lectures exists during the whole semester. \nParticipants carry out twelve experiments chosen from mechanics and non-linear dynamics, continuum mechanics, electromagnetism and optics. The experiments are more advanced than those offered in the first-year Natural Science Laboratory Course Module in Physics. Skills learned there can now be applied to gain a deeper insight into different aspects of advanced physics, partly already pointing to modern applications.",

This work is formally organized in the framework of Guided Research Courses (GRCs). A GRP may focus on experimental work, a field campaign, data analysis, computer simultations, theory, modelling, or a literature review. In order to be as effective as possible within the very limited amount of time, we stronlgy recommend to select one topic for both, the Fall and the Spring semester GRC. \nThe Fall semester GRC may involve a literature review in order to prepare for a project in Spring when a lab, field, data analysis, modelling, or theory project should be carried out. Students who are interested in taking a GRC in Geosciences and Astrophysics are invited to contact the instructors of record for more information on potential project topics. Each GRC must be concluded with a written report which will be graded.",

This course will be taught during the summer break, preferentially in early June or late August (ESS students who plan to take this course are advised to do their required internship between the 2nd and 3rd semester). In the course, students will be made familiar with geological features at various scales and with techniques applied in geological field work.The excursion focuses on geological sequences that illustrate the chemical evolution of the Earths lithosphere, oceans and atmosphere, water chemistry, and (depending on the region visited) the formation of metal deposits and their environmental impact. Hence, open-pit and underground mines are visited if possible. In the past this excursion took students to South Africa or Irland. Students are given the opportunity to acquire water or rock samples for their B.Sc. thesis project during this excursion.",

This includes the composition of freshwater (rain, lake, river and ground water) systems and seawater (including hydrothermal fluids and their role for the composition of the ocean) and the formation of marine precipitates. Processes along steep physico-chemical gradients such as oxic-anoxic layers, sediment-bottom water boundaries and seawater - hydrothermal fluid mixing zones will be another focus. The interface between the aqueous compartments and the biosphere will also be addressed.",

During two consecutive courses the students are exposed to a specific research area of physics in-depth. For this the student is required to participate in the research activities of a Jacobs University faculty member who participates in the Physical Sciences graduate program. Typically a continuous project defined by the supervising faculty member is conducted during the consecutive Advanced Guided Research courses. The research can involve experimental and-or theoretical topics. Grading for this course is based on lab performance and the quality of research reports. Furthermore, the Advanced Guided Research courses should enable the students for preparing a M.Sc. thesis in the 4th semester or entering the Ph.D. phase.",

        "Official Course Description": "Energy is indispensable to the functioning of a modern economy. Securing access to low-cost and reliable sources of energy while at the same time maintaining environmental stewardship are among the most pressing challenges of our age. The aim of this course is to introduce students to economic theories and analytical frameworks for analyzing these issues. The course will begin by covering the economics of energy supply, focusing on both renewable and non-renewable energy sources. On the demand side, the course will distinguish between energy use in the residential, industrial and transportation sectors. Finally, the course will address the functioning of energy markets and market design. This will include discussions on the international oil market, the markets for natural gas, developments in the coal market, and the economics of energy-environment interactions. The course will regularly draw on case studies to illustrate the theoretical concepts.",

This course introduces students to fundamental ideas on why organizations exist, how people behave in organizations, how organizations can be designed and changed strategically, and how they evolve in their environments. Managers also need to build and maintain inter-organizational relationships in projects, alliances, networks, supply chains and partnerships with various other organizations and in increasingly international contexts. The course covers classical principles of the division and integration of labor within and across firms. It also fosters a critical perspective on organizing as an ongoing creative, collective and contested practice that entails limitations for managerial control. Through project work, students learn what it means to be part of, and responsible for, contemporary organizations.",

It links the study of political and social movements trying to reform society and politics by way of transnational co-operation with the process of internationalizing cultural, political, and economic practices. The historical perspective recognizes the increasing, yet ambivalent transnational linking of societies. The tension between globalization and fragmentation can be studied in various areas, including the environment, consumer culture, peace movements, governmental organizations, and transnational corporations. The development started in Europe but soon encompassed the rest of the globe. The course provides students with a critical understanding of the making of today's international world.",

        "Official Course Description": "This lecture is conceived as an introduction to the history of South-, Southeast and East Asia from the 19th century to the present. Depending on the academic specialization of the professor, the focus can be on one region. Emphasis is being put on the connections, but also the demarcations within regions as well as their position within a global system of exchanges and power. The lecture combines a discussion of major developments with problems of Asian approaches to history. Major themes include but are not restricted to: the development of nationalisms and states; a discussion of colonialism and imperialism; problems of peace and war; identities; selected issues of social and cultural history (such as the role of religion in culture and society, ethnic relations; gender relations, etc.).",

        "Official Course Description": "Placed at the end of the history curriculum, this seminar with its deliberately open title provides students with an opportunity to draw together many of their previous experiences and apply it to the exemplary study of problems in cultural history. Hence, there is not a fixed agenda or syllabus for this seminar, but rather the defining idea of an advanced discussion of classical and current research in the field. This may include the in-depth study of particular theories and thinkers in cultural studies, as well as of empirical studies and monographs. At the end of this seminar, students should know about the development and different directions in cultural history, be familiar with some of the central theoretical approaches, and be able to assess one or more empirical fields. The thematic focus of the seminar may include, but is not limited to gender history and the history of the body, postcolonial history and national identity formation, popular culture and commercialization. Following the general idea of the history curriculum, treatment of these problems and topics will be in a broad and comparative, transnational perspective. The chronological focus of the seminar may shift between the early modern era and the late twentieth century, but the complicated processes of change and negotiation between \"traditional\" and \"modern\" forms of cultural production and expression will always be addressed.",

        "Official Course Description": "This course offers an introduction to the “reading” of visual art and will familiarize you with the basic technical terms, key analytic concepts, and fundamental theoretical methods of art history. Instruction will focus on the analysis and interpretation of original art works, including painting, sculpture, design, graphic works, photography, and installations, in the various museums, public and private art collection in Bremen and the region. Analyzing art works, reaching from examples of Medieval altar painting, Renaissance drawings, and Baroque sculpture to abstraction and contemporary art, the course will center around the methods of form and content analysis and provide you with hands-on experience and practical training in their use and application. Aim of the course is to give you an understanding of the various forms of representation in their historical settings as well as their broader theoretical significance.",

        "Official Course Description": "Mediality has shaped culture from its beginnings, as culture has become the hotbed and transmitter of innovative media development. The course scrutinizes the historical and conceptual entanglements between cultures and media from the modern to the postmodern era. It explores how cultures are essentially shaped and defined by mediality (oral culture, literary culture, visual culture, sound culture), and how the invention, acceptance and dissemination of new media result in a redefinition of culture, its societal conditions, functions and values (high culture versus popular culture; analogue culture versus digital culture, (inter-)national versus global culture etc). The main focus of the seminar will concentrate on the significant historical media change from the age of mechanical reproduction to the electronic age, namely from the book culture of the Gutenberg galaxy to the visual culture and net culture of the Turing galaxy. The aesthetic and social significance of new imaging technologies, including photography, film, television, video, multi-media installations and new electronic media, will be investigated and related to the heightened role of visual images in both modernity and postmodernity. Case studies and exercises in analyzing, interpreting, and contextualizing the historically complex relationships between cultures and media will be framed with theoretical texts on modern and postmodern media cultures.",

During the 19th and 20th century it was almost exclusively a ‘European affair’, but since the turn of the century there is a fruitful discussion of this concept especially in the United States. \n \nThe course deals with the most important exponents of the current debate and its preconditions and results. In a next step it questions the connection of the rise of world literature with the socio-economical as well as ideological advance of globalization. Finally it casts light on the historical roots of this concept which was coined by the late Johann Wolfgang Goethe and propagated by his liberal contemporaries in France as well as e.g. by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. \n \nInstruction focuses on the theoretical potential of this concept by discussing actual theoretical texts as well as those from its founding period. The aim of the course is to give students an understanding of the usefulness of theoretical debates in the hu-manities and of their applicability to actual problems in Literary and Cultural Studies.",

        "Official Course Description": "Placed at the end of the history curriculum, this seminar with its deliberately open title provides students with an opportunity to draw together many of their previous experiences and apply it to the exemplary study of problems in cultural history. Hence, there is not a fixed agenda or syllabus for this seminar, but rather the defining idea of an advanced discussion of classical and current research in the field. This may include the in-depth study of particular theories and thinkers in cultural studies, as well as of empirical studies and monographs. At the end of this seminar, students should know about the development and different directions in cultural history, be familiar with some of the central theoretical approaches, and be able to assess one or more empirical fields. The thematic focus of the seminar may include, but is not limited to gender history and the history of the body, postcolonial history and national identity formation, popular culture and commercialization. Following the general idea of the history curriculum, treatment of these problems and topics will be in a broad and comparative, transnational perspective. The chronological focus of the seminar may shift between the early modern era and the late twentieth century, but the complicated processes of change and negotiation between \"traditional\" and \"modern\" forms of cultural production and expression will always be addressed.",

It is not the intention of the course to introduce the participants to the law of Germany, Europe or any other specific part of the world. The course will explore general principles of law; principles that are common to many (or most) legal traditions. \n \nThe course covers questions around the definitions and sources of law; analyses the distinction between the branches of law and their principal characteristics; asks about the different legal traditions of the world; studies the concepts of legal interpretation; and gives an introduction to the internationalization, in particular the law of commerce. The question of law and justice will be dealt with in the last part of the course by referring to international human rights law and selected approaches in modern jurisprudence.",

Not only have the international legal rules embedded in international institutions such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the International Labour Organization and the European Union become more and more precise; the web of international legal rules has itself also become increasingly dense. Today these international rules define the rights (and duties) not only of states but also of social groups and individuals. In addition, these international rules are increasingly embedded in an institutionalized infrastructure in which legislation (rule-setting), adjudication (rule-application) and enforcement (rule-implementation) follow fundamental principles of due process. The course will consider the prospects and limitations (and even setbacks) of these transformations - i.e. legalization - while at the same time examining their causes and consequences.",

The seminar will then continue with a theoretical analysis of the methods for intercultural training and coaching varying in their scope from culture-specific to culture-general, and the evaluation of their effectiveness. The examined techniques will include deductive (such as classic lecture-style presentations) as well as experiential (such as role-play simulations) components.",

        "Official Course Description": "The study of memory seeks to understand how information is stored and retrieved, how new information is integrated to existing information, why we forget, and whether or not we can improve memory. The concept of model testing, i.e., stating assumptions and deriving predictions, empirical testing, and possible modification of the model, is introduced. \nThis lecture covers the following topics: \n \n- Sensory memory: Link between perception and memory; iconic memory; echoic memory; experimental paradigms such as partial report. \n- Immediate memory: Information to be retained only briefly; experimental procedures for investigating immediate memory such as free and serial recall, Brown-Peterson paradigm; models of immediate memory such as Broadbent's model of primary memory; Atkinson & Shiffrin's Dual Store model; serial position curves and its meaning for testing immediate memory; Sternberg paradigm for memory retrieval from short-term store; Baddeley's working memory model; levels of processing. \n- Generic memory: Information to be retained indefinitely; propositions and concepts; knowledge; models of semantic memory such as Collins & Quillian's hierarchical model; the feature overlap model; Collins & Loftus's spreading activation model including priming. \n- Forgetting: The failure to retrieve a memory of a previous experienced event; models of forgetting such as consolidation theory, interference theory; decay versus interference in immediate memory; retroactive interference; proactive interference. \n- Implicit memory: Memory without reference to a specific learning episode; Implicit versus explicit memory; indirect versus direct test; implicit learning; experimental dissociations; association priming; models of implicit memory such as activation, multiple memory systems, transfer appropriate processing, bias approach. \n- Memory and brain: The neural base of learning and memory; Information processing in and between neurons; synaptic plasticity; postsynaptic potential; classical conditioning; instrumental conditioning; Hebb rule; anatomy; cerebral cortex, methods of investigation such as EEG, ERP, CT, MRI, PET, fMRI. \n- Memory deficits: Amnesia and Alzheimer's disease; retrograde and anterograde amnesia; Korsakoff syndrome; methods to assess amnesia; case study; Alzheimer's disease and diagnosis. \n- Recognition: Identifying material that has been presented previously; signal detection theory; face recognition. \n- Reconstructive processes in memory: Eyewitness memory; flashbulb memory; hypnoses; emotion and memory; context and memory; cognitive interview; implanting memories (false memory). \n- Mnemonics: Strategies used to improve memory; levels of processing; PQ4R; method of loci; method of associations; method of key words; number-consonant alphabet.",

        "Official Course Description": "Communication and interaction are processes that can be studied at different levels. This course will initially investigate classical models of communication and introduce key concepts as they are used in psychology and related disciplines. Then communication and interaction will be analyzed from different view points focusing on the biological underpinnings in humans, the evolutionary perspective and specifically brain research on language and paralanguage. Communication and interaction will then be analyzed regarding their interaction in social context and in the light of relevant theories dealing with relationships and roles. Interindividual differences in communication skills will be discussed and applied issues such as training, assessment, and the internet will be touched upon. \nSpecific topics of this course include: \n \n- Theory of communication (codes, signs, channels, etc.) \n- Biological bases of communication \n- Communication in animals \n- Evolutionary approaches to communication and language \n- Neuroscience of language processing, psycholinguistics \n- Language and paralanguage/non verbal communication \n- The role of communication in the development of social cognition \n- Communication in social context \n- Cultural aspects of communication \n- Regulation of interaction \n- Dyadic interaction and communication in groups \n- Specific research methods \n- Mass media and communication \n- Communication and the arts \n- Internet \n- Nonverbal skills and emotional intelligence \n- Communication in business",

        "Official Course Description": "Cognitive scientists and cultural theorists traditionally have thought about the culture's influences on cognition quite differently. From a Cognitive Science perspective, the study of cognition typically is construed as the search for those aspects of mental experience that are uniformly true for all. In fact for much of the 20th century most psychologists assumed that all normal human beings were equipped with the same set of attentional, perceptual, memorial, learning, and inferential procedures. From a Cultural Studies perspective, there is no avoiding the cultural framework within which individuals think and act. The idea of universal mental experiences is often rejected outright by many cultural theorists; every human thought and perception is uniquely situated within a very specific framework informed by history, tradition, language, social context, etc. The goal of this seminar is to explore the dynamic of both perspectives by asking which aspects of human thinking and judgment are universally the same or culturally shaped. \nIn particular the following issues and questions will be addressed: \n \n- Definitions of culture and dimensions of cultural comparisons \n- Methodological challenges of studying culture's influences \n- Culture and systems of thought: Analytic versus holistic thinking \n- Causal attribution across cultures: How fundamental is the fundamental attribution error? \n- Cultural differences in reasoning: Western logic versus Eastern dialectics \n- The self-concept in a cross-cultural perspective: Independent versus interdependent self-construals \n- Culture and context: How flexible are cross-cultural variations in self-construals? \n- Does thinking about the self influence thinking in general? \n- Direct versus indirect communication in different cultures \n- Characteristics of cross-cultural interaction: Working in multi-cultural teams \n- Intercultural trainings \n \nThis seminar provides an introduction to important theoretical approaches from both Cognitive and Social Psychology as well as from adjacent other disciplines, like Anthropology or Ethnology. The discussed research findings may, however, help to improve cross-cultural interaction in many applied fields.",

        "Official Course Description": "Generally speaking, this course is about how individuals think and feel about members of other social categories (e.g. defined in terms of race or ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, weight, age group, disabilities etc.) and how they behave in relation to them - in other words, about the phenomena that have been termed \"stereotypes\", \"prejudice\", and \"discrimination\". These complex social psychological phenomena involve basic cognitive and affective processes in individuals as much as processes related to group norms, intergroup relations, and social construction in a given socio-cultural context. \nThe course covers the conceptualization and measurement of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination and, with consideration of multiple levels of analysis, their various sources as well as approaches to combating them. More specifically, the topics covered in the course include: \n \n-Prevalence of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination in society (e.g. at the workplace, in education); cultural differences \n-The target's perspective: consequences of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. stereotype threat, self-fulfilling prophecy) \n-History of research on stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination \n-Research methods and measurement of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. implicit and explicit measures, old-fashioned and modern racism/sexism) \n-Levels of analysis and different theoretical approaches (e.g. social cognition, social norms and identities, inter-group conflict) \n-The mental representation of stereotypes: person memory (schema, prototype, exemplar models), models of stereotype change \n-Cognitive and affective factors involved in stereotype activation and application (e.g. social categorization, automaticity, mood, motivation, self-esteem) \n-Individual differences in stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. personality, authoritarianism, social dominance orientation) \n-Social identity: the role of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination for group identity \n-Intergroup relations: how stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination depend on the relations between groups in society (e.g. competition for resources, intergroup threats) \n-Strategies to combat stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (stereotype suppression, contact hypothesis, Jigsaw classrooms, political correctness norms, collective action, societal and legal changes.)",

The choice of the question to be studied, the hypothesis, the operationalization of the variables, and the conduct of the study are to be performed by the students. This includes a much greater focus on and participation in the theoretical derivation of the research question than the Lab Course in Experimental Psychology I. \nThe course will be divided into group sessions in which common issues relating to the stages of the projects are discussed. In addition, there will be individual meetings with the groups linked to their specific projects. An emphasis is put on the translation of prescientific observations to clear hypotheses and their link to existing theoretical frameworks. Critical analysis and discussion of these elements are of particular importance. \nThe results of the studies are to be presented in the form of simulated conference presentations or posters.",

        "Official Course Description": "How can wide-scale social, economic and political change be achieved? In this course, we explore this question in the context of encouraging sustainability. To address global warming and environmental degradation, humans must adopt more sustainable lifestyles and switch from fossil fuel to low-carbon energy sources. Almost all countries, regions, companies and individuals must alter how they source and use energy. The main challenge to achieving this energy transition stems from human behavior and not from a lack of technology or scientific know-how. This course thus examines the transition from the perspective of the social sciences, including political science, sociology, psychology, economics and management. Some of the key questions the course addresses are: What is meant by sustainability? Are renewable energies sustainable? How can a change to sustainable energies be encouraged? What are the challenges? The aim of the course is to prepare students to critically assess sustainable energy policies from multiple perspectives.",

On the one hand, it provides unified symbolic frames and shared normative and cognitive understandings. On the other hand, its production is a highly contested terrain, prone to change and innovation. This seminar looks at culture from both angles. It examines the dynamics of symbolic and objectified meaning production, and analyses how culture affects, and is in turn affected by, social conditions and political institutions.",

We then proceed to the analysis of the policies and politics which unfold on this base. We inspect the four major policy-making institutions of the Union - the European Court of Justice, the European Commission, the Council of Ministers, and the European Parliament - scrutinize their interaction in the policy-making process, and examine some of the policy outcomes (part II). Finally, we will take a cursory look at the three main staples on offer for theorizing European integration - intergovernmentalism, neo-functionalism, and the governance approach (part III). \nA reader containing the required readings will be made available at the beginning of the semester.",

The course explores the different perspectives from which we can examine trafficking – as a criminal justice and organized crime problem, but also from the perspective of supply and demand, human rights, immigration, poverty and gender inequality.",

On the one hand, the course will provide the student with an overview of what public management is today, how it has changed in the past 30 or so years and where it is going. Not only will the course expose students to contemporary thinking in public management, by looking at the way public managers over the world deal with today's policy challanges, the course will also allow students to apply this knowledge to real cases. On the other hand, the course exposes students to the conceptual and methodological tool-box of contemporary policy analysis and, by drawing on real-life examples from a variety of policy domains, shows students how academic and professional policy analysts bring this tool-box to bear on issues of public management and public policy. Additionally, the course will show how different socio-cultural, political or disciplinary frames of references shape policy analysis and how policy analysts can use these frames to sharpen their understanding of the way public institutions are managed.",

        "Official Course Description": "During the Cold War, issues of international security were determining the international political scene. The risk of major international crises if not outright war determined strategic thinking and behavior. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it appeared that humanitarian intervention rather than military security was becoming the new paradigm. After September 2001, however, more aggressive conceptions of international security have again come to the fore. The goal of this course is to introduce major empirical issues about international security in a theoretically informed way. \nThe course therefore requires both a strong interest in theory and a willingness to engage in some research about the historical evidence. Students will have the opportunity to combine the theoretical and empirical knowledge acquired during the course in a series of working group sessions, joint presentations, and in their homework.",

        "Additional Information": "This course will provide you with a thorough introduction to the study of international security. It will do so by looking in some depth at the main theoretical approaches to understanding and advancing international security of the last fifty (or so) years. In the first part of the term, we will study the theoretical approaches that were en vogue in the “Third Great Debate” of the study of international relations (which took place roughly from the 1960s to the 1980s). In the second part, we will analyse the theoretical frameworks of the “Fourth Great Debate” (which has been raging from the 1990s up to now). I have selected pages from the books that I have always found most thought provoking and helpful. Quite a number of these publications are among the “classics” of the field. Furthermore, I have attempted to include, as much as possible, empirical applications of the theories to be discussed. \n \nYou will be required to finish all the required readings in advance. (Please note: the “background readings” are recommended only). To help you get motivated, I will test your knowledge of the required literature with a brief, written quiz every week. Both the mid-term and the final exam will be modelled on the “UK style” (see below). The mid-term exam will concern the contending approaches of the “Third Great Debate”, and the final exam will be about the theoretical competitors of the “Fourth Great Debate”. In class, we will practice regularly for these exams. This class is a seminar, and class participation is expected. \n \nThis is a mandatory course for the BA program in International Politics and History (IPH). \n- IPH students take this course in fall 2 (semester 3). \n \nPriority at registration will be given to the above mentioned cohort(s) of students. If places are still vacant students will be allocated randomly."

        "Official Course Description": "This course deals with the ethical dimension of international politics in general and of modes of international governance in particular. In the first part of the course participants are introduced to moral philosophy, with a special emphasis on problems of social justice. The second part considers representatives of the most important schools of thought in international ethics, commonly referred to as moral skeptics, communitarians (or statists), and cosmopolitans, and examines their ideas. Subsequently, the course focuses its attention on a range of more specific problems, each viewed from a normative perspective: the ethics of force and coercion (including intervention) in international politics; the nature, scope, and justifiability of distributive justice at the international and transnational levels (including the problem of intergenerational justice that comes into play in such issues as climate change); and the moral requirements of the global polity (including the problem of the world-state). Finally, the course looks at the possibilities of, and constraints on, transboundary ethical behavior and addresses the question of whether there is such a thing as moral progress at the international level.",

It introduces basic analytical concepts such as actors, different types of institutions, and forms of cooperation. Special emphasis is given to the field of international relations. The course deals with the conceptualization of actors and different types of actor constellations, basic institutional settings, and the role of interaction orientations. Guiding questions are: How can we explain cooperation and cooperation failure? \nWhat is the role of institutions in cooperation and cooperation failure? How do we account for institutional change? Throughout the course, the theoretical issues are illustrated with empirical examples.",

Though the course has its fair share of theory, empirical applications and examples will be offered and discussed every week. By the end of the course, you should also have a better understanding of the debates about the most pressing international issues of today, such as climate change, development aid, and terrorism."

        "Official Course Description": "This course builds on discussion of quantitative methods in Statistical Methods I. It focuses on multivariate statistical methods, in particular regression analysis, factor analysis, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis. The general objective is to make students intelligent users of the various multivariate statistical methods and enable them to make sensible decisions about when to use which procedure. This course, like the previous one, is divided into lecture and lab sessions. The lectures discuss the theoretical aspects of the different methods. The lab classes teach students how to run the relevant procedures in SPSS, how to interpret the computer output and how to effectively communicate the results of statistical analyses.",

You are therefore requested to do without such products on the days when the course sessions take place. If you forget, she may have to ask you to leave.

It gives examples of data retrieval and bibliographic databases, include discussions of common uses of secondary data analysis, address issues of methodology and interpretation, and train students in the practical application of secondary data analysis. The course is equally divided between lecture and lab sessions to provide students with both the theoretical underpinning as well as the practical tools for successful application of the analysis methods.",

We will examine how uncertainty and ambiguity may impact your perceptions of choices and risks, and also the role that interpersonal skills plays in convincing peers, colleagues or employees about decisions. A few real-life decision-making examples will be presented as case studies and used as practical exercises.",

        "Official Course Description": "The most important aspect while solving business case studies, especially during interviews with consulting companies is how to have a structured and systematic argumentation line. The interviewers are not looking for the right or wrong solution, but rather how you get to the answer. As an exercise in problem solving, it is all about the questions you ask, the issues you identify, the aspects you prioritize, the frameworks used and of course the confidence you present. In this sense, the Pyramid Principle has been extensively used especially by consultants in order to guide their structured thinking and writing processes. The Pyramid Principle offers simple guidelines on how to produce clear reports, dynamic presentations and successful proposals. Developed by the first woman consultant at McKinsey, Barbara Minto, this powerful technique has become the standard for all major consulting firms and professional organizations. The Pyramid Principle is based on scientific findings on how the brain works and teaches how to successfully deliver a story to any type of audience. \nThis hands-on workshop will provide you the theoretical background behind the Pyramid Principle and how it can be applied to successfully solve business case studies. As such, the workshop is structured in three main parts. \nPart I - Theoretical Background on the Pyramid Principle including many examples and how it can be applied to solving consulting case studies. This sessions will briefly cover the major business frameworks useful for the solving the case studies, namely profitability framework, Porter’s Five Forces, Marketing 4Ps and 4Cs, 7Ss and Contribution Analysis. \nPart II – Individual Exercises which aim mainly to ensure that all students understood the principles taught. \nPart III - Group Work where students will be divided in groups of 3-4 and will work on a given consulting case. The solution will be presented in front of everyone, feedback and discussion will follow. Moreover, a recommended solution for each case will be provided by the trainer.",

The focus of the seminar is on learning about and discussing methodological principles and rules whose purpose it is to help us plan, structure, and organize our research endeavors in ways that maximize the probability of achieving valid and relevant results, particularly in the area of “theory-oriented research” (where “theory” almost exclusively refers to “positive” rather than “normative” theory). It deals with questions such as the following: What are the features of a good research design? Which research questions are worth studying? What is a theory? How can we build and test theories? What is a scientific explanation? In addition, the seminar looks at some problems of the philosophy of social science, e.g. by reviewing the debate between “naturalists” (who argue that social science is about explaining collective human behavior in a scientific manner) and “interpretivists” (who argue that social life can only be understood from within).",

Although the philosophy underlying qualitative research will be touched upon, the focus will be less on methodological issues and more on actual research practice, enabling the students to conduct their own qualitative research. \n \nThe first part (weeks 1 through 7) will start out with a recap of qualitative research. The recap will be followed by sessions on case selection, qualitative research design and data collection. Course participants will then work on the design and data collection phase of their own individual research. \n \nIn the second part (weeks 8 through 14), methods for data analysis (such as coding, content analysis, or discourse analysis) and mixed methods research will be covered. The course will conclude with a session in which students present their individual research projects.",

This is vital for our understanding of the next material: Lewis dot structures, octet rule, electron ownership, resonance, bond angles, bond strength, bond order, molecular shape, conformation, transition states, and pKa (acidity/basicity). Functional groups (halides, alcohols, ethers, amines, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, anhydrides, acetals, etc.), nonmenclature, and chirality (stereogenic centers) are then addressed. This conceptual framework allows reactivity (electrophiles and nucleophiles) to then be discussed in the context of mechanistic pathways (SN1, E1, SN2, and E2) and the law of mass action. Specific functional group interconversions are then addressed beginning with an early discussion of carbonyl reactivity (enolates, imines, enamines, aldol reactions, etc.) to better facilitate our understanding of biochemical reaction pathways.",

After this, we introduce the essential techniques to: monitor and quench reactions (TLC, color change, neutralizing active chemicals, etc.), purify products (chromatography, crystallization, separatory funnel extractions, etc.), and spectroscopically identify compounds. In parallel, we introduce the equipment (rotary evaporator, melting point apparatus, etc.) and instrumentation (nuclear magnetic resonance (1H and 13C NMR)) to achieve those goals. After mastering these techniques, the next semester (Org Chem II lab) is devoted to the higher level goal of setting up reactions under diverse reaction conditions to produce pure compounds.",

The diversity of eukaryotic cell types and the complexity of cellular differentiation programs will be introduced at the molecular, structural, and functional levels. Students will learn about stem cells and how various cell types are integrated into tissues thereby building the organs of the body that enable physiologic functionality. We will discuss junctional complexes between cells in tissues and will understand how cells communicate with their environment by signal transduction processes. Based on the complex differentiation programs, developmental and morphogenetic processes generate body plans that are both, typical and characteristic for each organisms. At the end of the lecture students will have acquired a thorough understanding on how the cells and tissues found in round worms, fish, flies, rodents and humans are strikingly similar although different species are coping with the diverse environments they live in. The course will emphasize the principles of cellular and developmental biology, thereby highlighting physiology and also covering pathophysiology leading to disorders and disease.",

        "Official Course Description": "Part 1 introduces the student to the fundamental principles and concepts in the geosciences, and puts special emphasis on the Earth's internal structure and on plate tectonics. It then focuses on the \"Critical Zone\", i.e. on the complex near-surface environment in which interactions between rock, soil, water, air and living organisms define the natural habitat and control the availability of live-sustaining resources. Students will be introduced in a qualitative way to the basic components of and fundamental processes operating in the critical zone. \nIn part 2 it will be demonstrated how physical, chemical and biological processes interact in the geological environment and drive the functions of the ecosystem, and how human activities interfere with these natural processes. Anthropogenic changes in the ecosystem at local and global scales will be discussed, with emphasis on the degradation of the atmosphere, freshwater systems, soils, forests, grassland and cropland and the changes of polar and coastal regions. Strategies are proposed for controlling environment degradation from extraction and consumption of Earth resources and for maintaining a healthful and sustainable earth.",

Students will apply basic techniques (e.g., pipetting, dilution series preparation, spectrophotometry, thin layer chromatography) and learn how different biomolecules can be characterized by their specific biochemical properties. In-lab seminars will discuss the theory behind the experiments and the expected outcomes. The students will document and discuss their experimental data in publication-style reports. Theoretical preparation will be tested for by quizzes and the preparation of material safety data sheets (MSDS).",

        "Official Course Description": "This course is designed for students with an advanced knowledge of German (courses of B2 level, “Goethe-Zertifikat B2” or equivalent). \n \nThe objective of this course is to further develop your ability in (a) speaking, (b) reading, (c) writing, and (d) listening. At the same time you will get more familiar with (e) German culture by reading/watching quite various text and film genres. You will also review and learn (f) (grammatical) forms and structures. \n \n(a) Speaking: You will learn how to express yourself flexibly, spontaneously and fluently, giving clear and detailed descriptions, to precisely express your thoughts and opinions thanks to a good command of a wide range of verbal modes of expression. You will practice your speaking in class and during (panel) discussions and by giving short presentations. \n \n(b) Listening: You will learn how to follow extended speech, group discussions and debates on various, also non-familiar topics. The listening assignments will exclusively be based on authentic German texts and films. \n \n(c) Reading: You will learn how to understand longer and demanding texts, including journalistic, academic and literary texts. \n \n(d) Writing: You will learn how to write clear, well-structured texts on complex subjects with considerable accuracy. You will practice coherent writing using organizational patterns such as cohesive devices. To intensify the writing process we will establish a course blog. \n \n(e) Culture: The course will have a focus on film, i.e. you will watch short films, news shows, documentaries, commercials and a feature film (literary adaptation) that will especially exercise your listening abilities. At the same time you will learn about German culture or topics that are currently discussed in Germany. \n \n(f) Grammatical structures will be brushed up if necessary, but you will also learn new and more subtle structures such as modal particles, different phrasing (e.g. nominal style), and various and complex forms of attribution. \n \nAfter completing the level C1 successfully, you can take the corresponding Goethe language examination “Goethe Zertifikat C1” at the Goethe Institute in Bremen. Please check the website \n \nfor details on the examination “Goethe Zertifikat C1”: \nhttp://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/bes/gc1/enindex.htm \n \nfor details on times and fees: \nhttp://www.goethe.de/ins/de/ort/bre/prf/zc1/deindex.htm \n \n \n \nFor a detailed description of all language levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages check the Goethe website: \n \nhttp://www.goethe.de/z/50/commeuro/ \n \n \nTextbook: No general textbook, material will be provided",

        "Official Course Description": "Physics is the most fundamental of all natural sciences. A thorough background and understanding of physics is important for any description of natural systems. This course introduces to the basic principles of mechanics, thermodynamics, and optics. Emphasis is laid on general principles and fundamental concepts for the understanding of natural phenomena, not on an extensive mathematical description. Nevertheless, some basic calculus will be necessary to develop a scientific sound description of physical phenomena. Experiments and demonstrations are included in the lecture, and a tutorial is offered to discuss homework and topics of interest in more details. \nThe course consists of three main sections: The section on mechanics introduces the description of motion and the concepts of force and energy, including collisions, rotations, gravitation, and oscillations. The section on thermodynamics adds the concepts of heat and temperature to the description of natural systems including heat capacity, ideal gases, internal energy and the first law of thermodynamics. The section on optics introduces the concepts of light rays and waves to discuss optical instruments and the phenomena of interference and diffraction.",

        "Official Course Description": "Physics is an experimental science and the ultimate test for any theory or description of nature is the experiment. This lab course complements the Classical Physics lecture with experiments in the fields of mechanics, thermodynamics and optics. It deepens the understanding and extends the topics covered in the lecture, which is a corequisite for this course. Prior to the course, students need to attend the relevant safety instructions and will get an introduction into error analysis and calculation. The lab offers six different experiments and runs over six afternoons. The aim of the lab sessions is hands-on experience on how to investigate physical phenomena and topics presented in the lecture; to plan, carry out, and analyse experiments in physics; to describe, summarize and present experimental results adequately. Examples of experiments include the mathematical pendulum, ideal gas law and optical instruments.",

These include exercises to demonstrate the principles of industrial engineering methods (e.g. business process modeling, computer simulation of a production process, distribution planning, safety stock calculation, linear programming). In addition, students will also gain practical knowledge by means of two business games. The Presto business game will help students understand how important the organization of production processes is. Furthermore, the Beer Game (a computer based business game) will address the bullwhip effect in supply chains and improve students’ understanding of logistics and supply chain management. Finally, an excursion to a manufacturing company in Bremen will be offered within one lab session in order to show how production systems works in the industry world.",

This is contrasted with a first concrete model of computation: Standard ML, which will also act as the primary programming language for the course. We cover a basic subset of ML that includes types, recursion, termination, lists, strings, higher-order programming, effects, and exceptions. Back on the theoretical side, we cover string codes, formal languages, Boolean expressions (syntax) and Boolean Algebras (semantics). The course introduces elementary complexity theory (big-O), applying it to analyzing the gate-complexity of Boolean Expressions (prime implicants and Quine McCluskey's algorithm).",

We start by familiarizing the student with some general concepts of Electrical Engineering, such as charge and capacitance (electrostatics) and inductance (electrodynamics), resistance, (semi)conductivity and dopped materials, Ohm’s Laws, Kirchhoff’s Laws, etc. As the courses progresses, increasingly powerful circuit analysis tools are covered, including various circuit transformation tools such as Deltay-Wye, Source Transformation, Duality, Thevenin and Norton’s equivalents and Tellegen’s Theorem. The course then naturally moves to the analysis of the transient response of circuits with capactitor and inductors (RL, RLC, RLC and higher-order), including the Laplace Transform and various concepts that follows from the latter such as Impedance, Transfer Function (especially in relation to the study of OpAmp circuits), and Two-Port Networks. Theory is introduced through an alternation of expositive and exercise lectures, and the theoretical concepts are deepened by “hands on experience” in the accompanying Electrical Engineering I Lab, which is mandatory.",

This course introduces the field of microeconomics, focusing specifically on the role of markets in facilitating exchange between different groups of the economy such as workers, consumers, firms, and government institutions. Topics addressed include consumer theory, the cost structures and behavior of firms in various industries, competition, monopoly, and government regulation. The course applies theoretical concepts to contemporary policy questions, such as when government intervention is justified to correct market imperfections.",

The objective of this lecture is an introduction to a historical understanding of major processes in those two centuries, and the emphasis therefore is rather on historical concepts and interpretations than on summarizing facts and events. The course makes students aware of the particular identity of a common European history, and on the other hand, teaches them about the diversity of European cultures and regions of modern European history. Topics include the transformation of Ancient Régimes and revolutionary change; the emergence of industrial societies and economies; the formation of nation-states and empire-building, modern political ideologies such as liberalism, nationalism, or socialism; war, dictatorship and the European dimensions of the Holocaust; post-war prosperity and environmental changes.",

We will begin by examining the large-scale social trends and the conditions of the emergence of modern institutions. Contemporary markets, states and families will be studied in depth with respect to their functional differentiation, social stratification, and normative integration. \nSpecial effort will be put on comparing affluent and poorer societies and on social differences and inequalities between and within them. Finally, social processes like globalization and population aging challenge the social order of contemporary societies. We want to find out what has been changed during last decades and what may change in the future. Throughout the course, we will strike a balance between theoretical reflection and empirical analysis.",

Students learn about basic approaches towards research, such as quantitative and qualitative, basic and applied, descriptive and explanatory research, and about core concepts of empirical research such as research ethics, generating hypotheses and hypothesis testing, measurement, and evaluation criteria such as reliability and validity. The lecture shows how these concepts and ideas are applied in the context of various research techniques, for example surveys, experiments, field studies, case studies, or ethnographic research. It is also explained how researchers acquire their data, for example through constructing questionnaire items, conducting interviews, or through observation. All topics are illustrated using concrete research examples from different social science fields.",

Proper experimental design and accurate data analysis provide the basis for high quality research. Furthermore, data documentation and the scientific presentation of results are important academic skills a scientist needs to develop. Finally, any published work should follow good academic practice. \nThis course is a mandatory pre-requisite for all first year lab courses within the HEALTH focus (BCCB, chemistry, EES, MCCB and physics). Students will be introduced to basics in data acquisition and calculations as well as data and error analysis, e.g., the different types of errors and how reliable a final result can be regarding different inputs. They will learn how to properly depict (figures, graphs and tables) and describe their results in publication-style lab reports. The latter will also include scientific literature research and proper referencing. Students will also be instructed how to avoid plagiarism. \nThe course is complemented by mandatory safety instructions for the respective fields of research.",

        "Official Course Description": "Big data is one of the buzz words of this decade and refers to the collection and exploration of complex data sets. This complexity of big data is typically described by the four Vs: Volume, Velocity, Variety, and Veracity. From a business perspective big data is often portrayed as a sea of big opportunities. The public debate is torn between the two poles portrayed by the writers George Orwell and Aldous Huxley: complete surveillance and oppression on the one end, irrelevance and narcism on the other. The technological research quite naturally is mostly concerned with the technical feasibility of the approaches, the continuously increasing challenges with respect to the four Vs, and the creative solutions needed to tackle them. \n \nIn this course you will get an overview on big data by looking at it from various aspects, primarily the business and societal point of view. There will also be a fundamental exposition to the technological side of big data.",

To reduce their C02 emissions, many countries and regions are transitioning from fossil fuel to renewable sources of energy, including wind energy. Because of the high wind speeds found offshore, offshore wind offers significant potential as a source of renewable electricity. However, generating electricity from offshore wind poses technical, environmental, political and other challenges. Through cooperation between Jacobs University and the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) in Hamburg, students in this seminar will learn the fundamentals of wind energy as well as delve into the more complex issues and challenges posed by offshore wind technology.",

The course will introduce concepts of free expression and its limits, comparing especially absolutist U. S. with qualified European models. \n \nA particularly interesting focus of this general problem is offensive, humorous free expression: “Calm down, it was just a joke for ‘God’s’ sake!” Three specific questions will frame the comedic dimension of the analysis: what is the nature and the role of humor, is there a comedic ethics and does humor legally mitigate or aggravate offensive expression? \n \nThe course will consider the nature, history, and cultural diversity of violent societal conflict. In particular, the course will consider evolving definitions of “war” and attempts by international organizations to create a binding framework – legal or at least ethical – for constraining war.",

        "Official Course Description": "In spite of the fact that slavery has been abolished by all countries prior to, or during the previous century, it continues to flourish. In the 21st century people are still being traded and exploited in more than 180 countries in the world. Human trafficking, a form of 21st century slavery, comprises not only the exploitation of foreign women in forced prostitution, but also men and children forced to work in the sex industry, in domestic service, on farms, in factories and in the fishing, building, brick-making and construction industries. In fact, where there is a demand for cheap labor, trafficked victims can be found. Much has been documented concerning the exploitation of women and children in the sex industry, but little attention has been given to labor exploitation in other industries or to other forms of human trafficking such as the exploitation of child soldiers, mail order brides or persons for the purpose of harvesting their organs. \n \nThis introductory course will examine the definition of human trafficking and study the definition from the perspective of the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, to come to a full understanding of how human trafficking is defined. A discussion turns to what we actually know about human trafficking – how we measure the problem, where it occurs, and what major trafficking patterns have been identified worldwide. We will discuss why it is so difficult to determine just how many persons are being trafficked and whether a person is a trafficked victim. \n \nWe will examine which persons are more likely to fall prey to traffickers and how the trafficking experience impacts their lives, health and safety. Further study will focus on the traffickers – who they are and what is known about their modus operandi, how they recruit, transport and exploit their victims, but also how they protect their operations.",

The listening assignments will exclusively be based on authentic German texts and films. \n \n(c) Reading: You will learn how to understand longer and demanding texts, including journalistic, academic and literary texts. \n \n(d) Writing: You will learn how to write clear, well-structured texts on complex subjects with considerable accuracy. You will practice coherent writing using organizational patterns such as cohesive devices. To intensify the writing process we will establish a course blog. \n \n(e) Culture: The course will have a focus on film, i.e. you will watch short films, news shows, documentaries, commercials and a feature film (literary adaptation) that will especially exercise your listening abilities. At the same time you will learn about German culture or topics that are currently discussed in Germany. \n \n(f) Grammatical structures will be brushed up if necessary, but you will also learn new and more subtle structures such as modal particles, different phrasing (e.g. nominal style), and various and complex forms of attribution. \n \nAfter completing the level C1 successfully, you can take the corresponding Goethe language examination “Goethe Zertifikat C1” at the Goethe Institute in Bremen. Please check the website \n \nfor details on the examination “Goethe Zertifikat C1”: \nhttp://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/bes/gc1/enindex.htm \n \nfor details on times and fees: \nhttp://www.goethe.de/ins/de/ort/bre/prf/zc1/deindex.htm \n \n \n \nFor a detailed description of all language levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages check the Goethe website: \n \nhttp://www.goethe.de/z/50/commeuro/ \n \n \nTextbook: No general textbook, material will be provided",

The aim of this class is to provide a view on the French and the francophone culture, discuss it and compare it with the students’ cultural backgrounds. We will work on press articles, abstract of novels or films on a variety of topics such as shared apartments, music festivals and university or work environment in France and francophone countries. At the end of the B1 level, students should be able to cope with most of the situations one might be faced to on a trip in a country where French is spoken. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to, for example, describe your academic background to a future employer (use of past tenses), give your point of view and debate on a variety of subjects (different ways of expressing consequences, aims…) or help you to understand the main points of a radio or a TV broadcast.",

The aim of this class is to provide a view on the French and the francophone culture, discuss it and compare it with the students’ cultural backgrounds. We will work on press articles, abstract of novels or films on a variety of topics such as shared apartments, music festivals and university or work environment in France and francophone countries. At the end of the B1 level, students should be able to cope with most of the situations one might be faced to on a trip in a country where French is spoken. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to, for example, describe your academic background to a future employer (use of past tenses), give your point of view and debate on a variety of subjects (different ways of expressing consequences, aims…) or help you to understand the main points of a radio or a TV broadcast.",

We will work on press articles, abstract of novels or films on a variety of topics such as shared apartments, music festivals and university or work environment in Spain and Latin America. At the end of the B1 level, students should be able to cope with most of the situations one might be faced to on a trip in a country where Spanish is spoken. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to, for example, describe your academic background to a future employer (use of past tenses), give your point of view and debate on a variety of subjects (different ways of expressing consequences, aims…) or help you to understand the main points of a radio or a TV broadcast. Also we will read a short novel. And we might go to watch a movie. \nStudents attending these courses can reach language level B1 (according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). Furthermore, after a successful completion of these courses, you can take the corresponding DELE B1 examination at the Instituto Cervantes in Bremen.

        "Official Course Description": "B1.1 and B1.2: \n \nThese courses are designed for students with an intermediate knowledge of Spanish (A2.2 class or equivalent). \nIn class, we will work on five competences: oral - writing production and oral - written comprehension and interaction. The aim is to provide a view on the Spanish and the Latin American cultures, discuss it and compare it with the students’ cultural backgrounds. We will work on press articles, abstract of novels or films on a variety of topics such as shared apartments, music festivals and university or work environment in Spain and Latin America. At the end of the B1 level, students should be able to cope with most of the situations one might be faced to on a trip in a country where Spanish is spoken. \nGrammar structures will also be studied, but the focus will be on the use of grammatical form to enable you to, for example, describe your academic background to a future employer (use of past tenses), give your point of view and debate on a variety of subjects (different ways of expressing consequences, aims…) or help you to understand the main points of a radio or a TV broadcast. Also we will read a short novel. And we might go to watch a movie. \nStudents attending these courses can reach language level B1 (according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). Furthermore, after a successful completion of these courses, you can take the corresponding DELE B1 examination at the Instituto Cervantes in Bremen. Please check the website for details on the examination: \n \nhttp://diplomas.cervantes.es/informacion/niveles/nivel_b1.html or \nhttp://nivelesb.diplomas.cervantes.es/b1.htm",
