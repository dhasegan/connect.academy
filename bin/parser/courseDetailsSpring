By studying different styles of music as well as various aspects of music theory and the mathematical concepts involved, the course aims to provide the students with a foundation to apply statistical processes for musical analysis. Beginning with a history of the study, followed by an in depth analysis and theoretical foundation, and ending with an independent student project, the course offers theoretical basis leading to practical application. Group projects will involve developing a method for statistically analyzing a live stream of biometric data (e.g. movement of a participant in interactive installation or a dancer on stage) and creatively manipulating it using algorithms and filters to generate a contemporary sound composition. An approach to sonification of data will be used to gain insight into periodicities and patterns within the data itself. Given that sound offers a myriad of qualities, data may be mapped to any number of sound parameters, thus opening up new ways to understand data or information, and even reveal formerly hidden structures and meaning. \nArtists, practitioners and lecturers from relevant areas of the arts, statistics, and psychology sectors, will be invited to contribute to this course. In addition, analysis/demonstrations of recent interactive performances realized by the author and other artists will provide a hands-on opportunity to better understand the creative and technological processes.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

There is, nevertheless, the common understanding that each society has law and that the function of such law is providing rules for the organisation of that society, including the behaviour of its members. \n \nListening to ordinary voices, we hear that certain behaviour is called \u0093unethical\u0094, or \u0093immoral\u0094. This can happen when somebody acts in a specific way, which is seen to be in violation of ethical standards or moral obligations, or a person does not act at all although he / she was expected to act. For some, including scholars of philosophy, ethics and moral (and / or the morals) are used interchangeable. Others draw a distinction between ethics and moral. According to this, ethics is part of philosophy and as such the meta-level which reflects on norms, be them legal or non-legal. In this sense, the moral norms in a society, which are not necessarily included in the respective legal order, are subject of ethics. \n \nEthics reflects normative perceptions. Ethical discourses collect and research the social foundation of moral perception. Ethics describes, questions, reasons, substantiates and develops normative perceptions, standards and rules. The various theories of ethics, theories reaching from Aristotle to Kant, from Rawls to modern proponents of hermeneutical ethics contribute to the vast field of ethics in their specific manner. Ethical reflections explore the viability of the ethical instruments submitted by ethical theory for the ethical solution of problems, including problems described as \u0093ethical dilemmas\u0094. However, the bigger part of the ethical discourse focuses on approaches to ethics in the philosophy of the western world and, with this, addresses the Western move to the secular state and the subsequent emphasis on (secular) ethics. Questions about ethics and the relationship of ethics and law in other frames of thoughts, e.g. the Islamic, the African or the Chinese frame of thought, in particular, require attention when problems arising from cultural diversities have to be dealt with. \n \n Teaching credits (non-public):\n 2", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "6.

The relationship between the two concepts \u0093society\u0094 and \u0093technology\u0094 is subject to continuous adaptation. We shall explore the relationship based our expertise and on the scientific literature on knowledge creation and innovation processes. Based on the concept of \u0093creative destruction\u0094 coined by Schumpeter as a driver of economic and social change we investigate throughout the course the distinction between incremental development versus radical innovation. Examples of innovation processes range from energy, transport, architecture, military, fashion, press and social media to biological innovation. \nHaving introduced the basic concepts for analyses of such innovation processes students will carry out own projects or case studies of specific technological or societal innovations. Within these projects, the social and economic process of what leads to the innovation as well as the likely or already observed impact of the innovation will be investigated. Students can choose an innovation process of their choice in agreement with the course instructors and prepare a presentation and written documentation of this process. In addition each student will present a \u0093technology assessment\u0094 based on a real product inspection in combination with a visit to the CEBIT and/or HannoverMesse 2014 as a professional environment.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "7.

On the food chemistry side a basic introduction to the chemistry of food will be given including types of nutrients, chemical composition of food, energy considerations for food intake and the biochemistry of the digestive system. The course will be complemented by selected specialized topics including food choice, historical changes of food consumption patterns, health and attraction of food. On the psychological side of food, topics like mood, emotions and stress, different social influences, dietary changes, food cravings and weight control will be covered. \nWe will discuss the state of the art, techniques, general challenges and evidence-based approaches to understand all these matters and to make informed choices as well to help others effectively. A significant amount of time will be devoted to practical training and exercises to get a deeper understanding of the theoretical aspects and to enable you to apply your new knowledge to your professional work.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "7.

Who is healthy? Which behaviors are health related in which people? How can we support individuals adopting and maintaining healthy lifestyles? \nIn western industrialized nations, an increasing amount of people reach old and very old age whilst birth rates decline. This trend coincides in an increasing need to promote a healthy lifestyle and in turn to promote successful and productive aging. \nThe USC will provide you with multiple facets of health ranging from different health models and health behaviour models to different lifestyle factors that promote health across the lifespan. Further you will get hands on tools to assess health and successfully improve health behavior. We will investigate different options on campus which might be health (behaviour) related i.e. might improve or impede health (behaviour) or might be an environment to study health related topics. Students are expected to work on small group projects which will be presented in the end of this course in form of posters. \n \n Teaching credits (non-public):\n 2", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

However, the basic outlines of today's theory of computational \n complexity will be presented up to the most famous open problem in computer science, namely the famous ``P = NP'' question: if a computer can guess the answer to a problem (and only needs to check its correctness), does that really help to speed up computation? \n \nTopics: \nComputable functions and complexity, lambda calculus, functional programming.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "6.

On \nthe conceptual level, mastering the rapidly growing volume and complexity of information in \nindustry, science, and society requires improved modelling and design methodologies. On the \nimplementation level, existing storage, retrieval, and delivery techniques have to be revisited \nand new ones have to be designed in order to meet the challenges formulated conceptually. \nWhile these issues largely fall into the fields of databases, information retrieval, and Internet \ntechnology, the questions arising clearly transcend these fields and call for interdisciplinary \nresearch on more efficient and effective methods. \nThe course, therefore, starts with an overview of existing knowledge in the core fields and then \ncovers selected themes in more depth. Among the candidate themes are non-standard applications \nsuch as spatio-temporal databases and sensor networks, distributed databases, XML \ndatabases, multimedia databases, streams, raster databases, storage structures, and query optimization. \nGoal is to make students familiar with the state of the art in Web-enabled information systems \nso that they will be successful database/Internet professionals in IT industry and also have a \nsound knowledge base to specialize towards a scientific career in the field.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

At each time of class, students will meet with a faculty member to discuss one or more papers authored by scientists/laboratories which lead the respective field of research. Active participation of the students will be in form of detailed scientific presentations of the published experiments and their background and conclusions, respectively, followed by an in-depth discussion with all students and the faculty member(s). \nSince state-of-the-art science lives from communication among scientists, the prime purpose of this seminar series is to enable students to communicate advanced scientific topics.

It has fourteen sessions. \nThe course builds on the understanding of biological systems established in the undergraduate courses, Advanced Cell Biology I+II and Advanced Biochemistry and Molecular Biology I+II, or equivalent. Although a brief introduction will be given, graduate or undergraduate students who have no foundation in cell biology should consider attending Advanced Cell Biology prior to this course. \nThis is an intensive course, based on advanced textbooks, scholarly reviews, and recent research articles, that will take students to the cutting edge of a few select fields. The topics are a selection of complex and integrated systems from all areas of biochemistry and cell biology that change from year to year, and that are typically analyzed on all levels from their molecular mechanism to their cellular manifestations. They may include intracellular trafficking of proteins and lipids, synthesis and turnover of cellular components, regulation and signal transduction, and development and cooperation of cells in tissues. \nThe course will also provide and train skills that are needed to understand and critique published data. \nEach subject is typically covered by: \n- a lecture-style initial introductory overview by the instructor; \n- a thorough discussion of selected topics that requires prior reading of review articles; \n- student presentations of research papers including a detailed analysis. \nPrior reading of the provided literature is essential, required, and relevant for the grade.", "Credits": "2.50", "Appointments": [{"start": "7.

Students will analyze the principles of lean manufacturing during a \u0093paper plane game\u0094. The goal of this exercise is to illustrate significant effects of different types of supply control (push/pull) on indicators such as WIP, throughput time, cycle time respectively worker behaviour. Students will also be familiarized with the topics of Supply Chain Risk Management and Supply Chain Security. In a Game Based Learning exercise for Supply Chain Security the students have to act as real supply chain actors. \n \nMoreover, the course will have a strong focus on the shipping industry, students will be introduced to the ways in which shipping is organized in the modern, globalized economy. They will analyze the per item shipping costs of modern container shipping. They will also learn about the elements that affect the supply and demand side of shipping markets, about the generally assumed behaviour of the supply and demand side under the criteria of perfect competition and how the market balance is achieved in the long-run-, short-run-, and immediate market environment. Furthermore, students will have an exercise focused on one segment of heavy cargo logistics \u0096 the offshore wind sector. Students will be introduced (by means of role games) to the challenges of offshore wind energy \u0096 looking at the industry from a logistics point of view. \n \nFinally, an excursion to a logistics company in Bremen will be offered within one lab session in order to show how logistics works in the industry world.", "Credits": "2.50", "Appointments": [], "CourseName": "NatSciLab Unit Logistics II", "Course Name Abbreviation": "NatSciLab Unit Logis", "Type": "Lab"}, {"Partial Grades": "Final Grade", "Name": "050212 Process Modelling and Simulation", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351624061220460,-N351624061286461,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Min. | Max. participants": "- | -", "Instructors": "Prof. Dr. Asvin Goel", "Catalogue": "Spring > School of Engineering and Science > Logistics > Undergraduate Level Courses", "CourseID": "050212", "Official Course Description": "A necessary prerequisite for designing and improving \nbusiness processes is an in-depth understanding of these \nprocesses.

Particular attention is paid to the two dimensions of logistics value generation, \"Service Excellence\" (effectiveness based value generation) and \"Cost Minimization\" (efficiency based value generation). The major reasons why (and how) firms measure distribution logistics performance, to reduce operating costs, drive revenue growth and enhance shareholder value are examined during the lecture and by utilizing case studies. \nThe course is divided into two main parts. For one, students are expected to attend classes and complete a number of case studies in a group setting. The cases serve to get an in-depth look at the real life implications of distribution value generation and the impact that logistics has on corporate success. The cases also train the analytical and management decision making skills of the students. \nIn addition, students have to write a 12-15 page seminar paper. Topics for the paper will be individually assigned to the students by the instructor. The paper gives the students the chance to explore some of the topics discussed in class in more depth and from a scientific as well as practical perspective. \nAfter the completion of the course students will: \n- have a solid understanding of value generation and value measurement in a distribution logistics setting \n- understand the different dimensions of the distribution logistics value proposition \n- realize the accute importance of logistics value generation in order to gain long term sustainable competitive advantages \n- be able to apply the learnings in a real world setting", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "17.

Furthermore, logistics processes are highly distributed among departments (e.g. procurement, production, distribution) and even companies. Therefore, communication technology as a foundation for implementing distributed information systems is another topic. \n \nThe objective of this course is to enable logisticians to communicate with IT professionals in designing information systems for logistics. To this end, a focus lies on modelling information systems with respect to processes, data, information, and knowledge. Furthermore, future developments in ICT that do not only incorporate information systems but also automated control are discussed.

We introduce the dual vector space and dual linear maps and their relation \nwith bilinear forms. Classifications are given of symmetric and skew-symmetric real bilinear \nforms and of Hermitian and skew-Hermitian forms over the complex numbers. \nThe last part is concerned with tensors \u0097 objects that play an important role in many \nbranches of physics and mathematics. The tensor product of two (or more) vector spaces is \nintroduced and properties are discussed including the universal property, contraction of tensors, \n\u0091outer\u0092 and \u0091inner\u0092 products, and the relationship between linear maps and tensors.", "Credits": "7.50", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

Possibly this \nis extended to include some more advanced cryptography (like secret sharing cryptography). \nThen we proceed with quadratic residues, quadratic reciprocity theorems, and sums of squares. \nNaturally, this extends into quadratic forms. We then discuss the p-adic numbers. At some \npoint during the course, the prime number theorem is covered.

Lerchl) \nBiology is around us; we ourselves are components of \"biology\". To appreciate our position in nature, we need to know something about life itself, about different life forms, and the way living organisms interact with each other and with environmental features. The lectures are designed to provide the students with a taste of fundamentals of biology (reproduction, genetics, cell biology), biodiversity and the concept of ecosystems. Additionally, the fundamentals of endocrinology, chronobiology and sensory systems are covered. \n \nChemistry Module (Prof. T. Nugent) \nOur development as societies is directly shaped and advanced by our understanding, use of, and continual redefinition of the chemical sciences. Some of the foremost problems facing mankind are currently energy, environment, food, and medicine; and chemists will be there to meet those challenges. During this course we touch on foundation material as diverse as reaction stoichiometry, chemical equilibria, acids and bases, redox reactions, nuclear chemistry, carbon dating, the origins of life, photosynthesis, and fuel cells. In doing so, we will address and better appreciate mankind\u0092s challenges. The course is geared toward a student audience that has not taken General Inorganic or Organic Chemistry. \n \nPhysics module (Prof. H. Meyer-Ortmanns): \nPhysics provides the basis for understanding weather and climate, radiation and radioactivity, energy balance and pollution of various kinds. This module gives a survey on forces in nature, electromagnetic radiation and radioactivity, wave phenomena on various energy and length scales. It also reviews concepts of fluid mechanics of liquids and gases, transport of heat, mass and momentum, and the different processes behind the transport. In view of the topical discussion on renewable energy we present the various forms of energy, their mutual transformation as well as the basic physics behind nuclear power, that is nuclear fission and fusion.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

There is growing evidence that the biota of Amazonian ecosystems is increasingly affected by climate change. Increased frequency of extreme drought and flood events particularly during the last decade puts the conservation of the Amazon forest in the forefront of public attention. However, deforestation by humans still endangers large parts of forests and locally reinforces natural climate trends. In addition, predictions of impacts of climate change on a basin-wide scale mostly fail because of the huge dimensions of the Amazon and the variability of its range of different ecosystems. \nThe course gives an introduction to the biogeography and evolutionary history of the different Amazonian ecosystems with special emphasis on Amazonian wetlands, which cover approximately 30% of the area of the biodiversity.

It is neither the traditional experimental physics lecture, nor a \npure theoretical physics course. Both aspects are combined, special emphasis is laid on general \nprinciples, not on mathematical derivations. Nevertheless, the course teaches calculus based \nphysics and some mathematical knowledge will be required. Experiments are integrated into \nthe lectures. \nThe course introduces the following topics: \n\u000f Special relativity: Lorentz transformation, rest mass. \n\u000f Quantum physics: photons, electrons, wave nature of particles; Schroedinger equation, \nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. \n\u000f Atomic physics: X-ray and atomic structure, periodic systems, spin electronic excitations, \natomic spectra. \n\u000f Molecules and condensed matter: molecular bonds and vibrations; crystals and semiconductors. \n\u000f Nuclear and particle physics: elementary particles, accelerators and detectors, quarks, \nstandard model, decay of nuclei, nuclear reactions, nuclear fusion and fission.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

The assessment of the explanatory power of reductionism is a controversial issue, even between two Nobel prize winners from physics, Steven Weinberg and Phil Anderson. We shall first illustrate reductionism\u0092s success in different areas of physics: relativity theory, gauge theories of the standard \nmodel, self-organized processes like pattern formation in cosmology, the renormalization group approach in condensed matter theory, and more generally topics of multi-scale modeling. The success becomes possible due to a few guiding principles, the exploitation of symmetries, but also due to large-scale computer simulations. Therefore one may be tempted to jump to conclusions and postulate the existence of a \u0093world formula\u0094 or a \u0093theory of everything\u0094, such postulates are found in the literature until recently. Pointing out the \nlimitations of reductionism in the second part of the course, it will become clear why such postulates are not meaningful. Limitations show up when the goal is to predict not only a single aspect, but the whole variety of emergent phenomena on a higher level of description when starting from a more fundamental one. We shall also review the very formulation of physical laws in stochastic and deterministic versions, the increasing complexity in the description that one has to face if \nthe goal is to capture distinct aspects at the same time. Along with a comparison of stochastic and deterministic formulations, an important topic in the theory of evolution will be discussed. It is related to the role of contingency and necessity in time evolutions, in particular in the evolution of the universe. Here well-known representatives of opposing viewpoints are the paleontologists and biologists S. J. Gould and S. C. Morris. The reviews on topics from physics will be supplemented by some presentations from the philosophical side, discussing \ntheories of explanation in physics and biology. From illustrations of the successful application of reductionism in different branches of physics, undergraduate students are expected to receive first reviews on achievements rather than a detailed understanding. A deeper understanding can be gained upon specialization on the graduate level. On the other hand, pointing out the limitations of reductionism opens the view for the need to include other disciplines than physics to approach complex systems in all their facets.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

In order to be as effective as possible within the very limited amount of time, we stronlgy recommend to select one topic for both, the Fall and the Spring semester GRC. \nThe Fall semester GRC may involve a literature review in order to prepare for a project in Spring when a lab, field, data analysis, modelling, or theory project should be carried out. Students who are interested in taking a GRC in Geosciences and Astrophysics are invited to contact the instructors of record for more information on potential project topics. Each GRC must be concluded with a written report which will be graded.", "Credits": "7.50", "Appointments": [], "CourseName": "BSc Thesis Earth and Space Sciences", "Course Name Abbreviation": "GR GeoAstro II", "Type": "Lecture/Lab"}, {"Partial Grades": "Final Exam (85%)\nActive Participation (15%)", "Name": "210382 Advanced Physical Oceanography", "CampunetLink": "https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000001,-N000124,-N0,-N351625015529560,-N351625015577561,-N0,-N0,-N0\n", "Min. | Max. participants": "- | -", "Instructors": "Prof. Dr. R\u00fcdiger Gerdes; Prof. Dr. Joachim Vogt", "Catalogue": "Spring > School of Engineering and Science > Natural and Environmental Sciences > Undergraduate Level Courses", "CourseID": "210382", "Official Course Description": "The goal of this course is to provide understanding of ocean processes and their role in climate. Fundamental concepts and their mathematical description will be introduced. The course will derive the basic equations governing the oceanic circulation and the transport of mass and tracers in the ocean. Useful approximations to these equations and their range and applications will be discussed. Starting from problems like the variability of oceanic meridional heat transport and sea level change, the course will introduce important elements of the oceanic general circulation. Topics include adjustment processes through waves, Ekman boundary layers, wind-driven and thermohaline circulation.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "7. Feb. 2014 09:45", "end": "7.

Analytical chemistry deals with the separation, identification and quantification of any chemical compound. It therefore provides an interface between the traditional areas of organic, inorganic and physical chemistry with life sciences and all other areas of science requiring identification and quantification of chemical compounds. Analytical chemistry provides the tools for all areas of experimental chemistry and a good foundation of analytical techniques is not only expected of any chemist but also life scientist. The course will give an introduction into analytical chemistry with selected applications in environmental chemistry. This will include an introduction to analytical terms and definitions, basic statistic treatment of experimental data, qualitative and quantitative analysis and instrumental analysis with emphasis on spectroscopic techniques such as UV/Vis, NMR, mass spectrometry, IR and Raman spectroscopy and fluorimetry.

In the first part, the concept of nanoparticles and nanoscale materials is introduced. The effect of nanoparticle size on their physical and chemical properties when going to the nanoscale is explained. The \u0091nanoworld\u0092 lies in-between the atomic scale, where quantum mechanics rule, and classical mechanics in the bulk material. This part will apply these observations on metal and ceramic nanoparticles, and special focus will also be given to the different chemical pathways used in order to obtain the most homogenous size distributions of such materials. The second part deals with an introduction to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, with a focus on applications in inorganic and materials chemistry. Initially, NMR is compared to various other analytical techniques (e.g. IR, UV-vis, Raman, XRD, EPR, M\u00f6ssbauer), and their respective advantages and disadvantages discussed (e.g. time scale, sensitivity, selectivity, sample preparation). Then a basic introduction to NMR is presented, the underlying theory of the technique as well as instrument hardware. The most important experimental aspects and NMR parameters such as chemical shift, scalar coupling, relaxation delay, decoupling, T-dependence, quadrupolar nuclei, and 2D NMR are presented. The main portion of this course deals with a discussion of actual examples of inorganic compounds from the literature. A non-mathematical, descriptive approach is used throughout. The third part of this course deals with the description of molecules and matter from a chemical point of view, with an emphasis on basic concepts of chemical bonding, including simple covalent bonds, delocalization, intermolecular interactions to create assemblies, and the mechanical bonding relevant in supramolecular and nanomolecular systems. An introduction into photonic processes will be given in terms of photochemical reactions and photoinduced electron transfer. Properties of matter are viewed in terms of thermodynamic aspects, highlighting enthalpic and entropic effects as the driving force for chemical reactions, solvent effects, isotope effects, properties of phase mixture, etc.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

Since the field of modern economic history has witnessed a major transformation, with a significant expansion of both its subject area and its theoretical foundations, the classical process of the Industrial Revolution in technology and production will form an important starting point, but will not any more exclusively define this field. Attention will also be given to the preconditions of industrial growth in the agricultural and commercial economy of early-modern Europe. The history of economic processes has begun to include not just production, but also trade and consumption, as modern societies are increasingly defined as \"consumer societies\". In addition, the \"cultural turn\" has had its impact also on economic history, leading to a new emphasis on economic action, economic ideology, and the cultural implications of economic behavior. The lecture provides an overview over both classical and new topics in modern economic history, from early-modern beginnings to postwar economies after 1945 and issues of economic \"globalization\", and at the same time introduces students to different ways of conceptualizing past economies. The chief interest lies on Western economies, but their interrelations with local and dependent economies on the fringes of the Western world are also considered.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "7.

It provides an opportunity for a more detailed study of international relations in a broad sense, i.e. including politics and transnational activities. The analysis of major conflicts and developments from the First World War to the end of the Cold War provides students with a critical understanding of the making of today's world. Through the close reading of available documents and the engagement with scholarly debates, the structure of international relations, its institutions and underlying forces, as well as major events which shaped politicians' behavior gain life. The course focuses on issues like the origins of wars, peace-making, collective security, crisis management, economic dependency and cultural diplomacy. It highlights features particular to the twentieth century; the potential of mass destruction and its realization, the role of ideologies, the expansion of international organizations, economic relations and an increasing but uneven linkage between societies all over the world. The tension between fragmentation and globalization, which we still see today, is thus explained in historical terms.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "6. Feb. 2014 14:15", "end": "6.

Beginning with the Word War I and the Versailles System, the course aims at providing students with a deeper understanding of major political events and changes of international power relations. Foci will be laid on cold war, decolonization, \n \nIn contrast to usually constructed IR courses this course does not deal with major political events in chronological order, rather it intends to develop answers to crucial questions related to the understanding of shifting power relations in the 20th Century. Empires and imperial states (Germany, France, UK, Russia) were losing political importance while new states (USA, and Third World countries like Egypt, India and China after decolonization) and new challenges in the age of cold war gained more and more international attendance. This IR course deals with the following main questions: \n1. Why governments did start a world war and why didn\u0092t it end earlier (only after four years)? Topics: World War I and the Versailles System \u0096 the great watershed of the 20.th Century geo-political history or the \u0093seminal catastrophe\u0094 of the 20th Century. \n2. Why socialism/Marxism failed? What went wrong? The Russian Revolution and the \u0093age of socialism 1917-1991\u0094: Lenin, Stalin, Brezhnev, Gorbachev \n3.

What was and who or what ended the Cold War (1946/47 -1989/1991)? Did nuclear deterrence work? Topics: USA\u0092s foreign policy of containment and d\u00e9tente, Truman doctrine, Carter Doctrine; the USSR\u0092s doctrines of \u0093peaceful coexistence\u0094, Brezhnev doctrine; Gorbachev\u0092 s policy of Glasnost and Perestroika \n7. How European nation states achieved \u0093perpetual peace\u0094 (I. Kant) among themselves after 1945, i. e. economic integration and political unity of the EU? \u0096 a \u0093miracle of world-historical importance\u0094 (Robert Kagan)? Topics: The foundation of European Coal and Steel Community, Treaties of Rome, Maastricht, and Lisbon. Causes and risks of South and East enlargements of the EU. \n8. What are \u0091defensive weapons\u0092? Topic: Was the \u0091dual track decision\u0092 (NATO-Doppelbeschluss) in 1979 a \u0091right answer\u0092 to the \u0091modernization\u0092 of Soviet weapons (SS-20 deployment) under GS Brezhnev; deployment of Cruise Missiles and Pershing II in order to maintain the \u0093nuclear balance\u0094 in Europe in 1983. \n9.

Thereafter the international conventions for the carriage of goods by sea, by air and by land including multimodal carriage will be subject of the course. Since logistics is a manifold area we will have to include several aspects like law of warehousing and the assembling of products. The handling of dangerous goods is sub-ject to a legal frame which also is shaped by international regulations and are dealt with in the lectures. \n \nAt last, we will focus on the law of other contracts which are necessarily connected with the transport/logistics, e. g. insurance (marine and liability insurance), agency, construc-tion and long term contracts, product liability. \n \nOf course the student should be aware that the legal entities acting in the logistic busi-ness have different legal structures. Therefore, an outlook to the company law will be given. Professionals might get in contact with labour law, that is why an introduction should be given also to this. \n \nThe course will end with an outline of the international private law (conflicts of law), juris-diction, litigation and arbitration.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "13.

Processes of media reception, as well as meaning attribution to media products are discussed, covering traditional mass media like television and cinema, but also aspects of online communication.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

Organization relevant factors such as organizational structure, workgroup/team, motivation, etc. will be illuminated in a cultural context. Based on the analysis of cultural environment and embedment, cross-cultural managerial activities will be elaborated in the process and behavior of decision making, leadership, communication, and negotiation across cultures.

Sensation refers to the process of detecting a stimulus or a stimulus property in the environment. It is the necessary collection of information about the world from which perceptions will be made. Perception refers to the way in which we interpret the information that is gathered by the senses. The process of perception can not be understood while ignoring the known physiology of the sensory systems that underlies the perceptual process. The course covers both physiological explanations for phenomena of perception and more cognitive aspects of the perceptional process, for which a physiological explanation might be available in the future. \nThis lecture covers the following topics: \n \n- Methods of investigation: Phenomenological method; psychophysical methods such as methods of limits, method of constant stimuli, magnitude estimation, and basic ideas of signal detection; psychophysical measures such as absolute threshold, difference threshold, adaptation; Fechner's law, Weber's law, Stevens' power law. \n- Visual perception: The visual stimulus, the structure of the eye, neural processing including basic neural circuitry, and information flow and organization in the brain; perception of objects and models of object perception such as the Gestalt approach, feature integration theory (Treisman), recognition-by-component model (Biederman), Marr's computational approach; perception of depth, monocular depth cues, binocular depth cues; perception of color and models of color perception such as trichromatic theory, opponent-process theory; perception of movement, motion sensing systems such as image-retina system, eye-head system, corollary discharge theory; perceptual constancies such as color constancy, size constancy, lightness constancy, shape constancy; and phenomenon such as visual illusions. \n- Auditory perception: The sound stimulus, the structure of the ear, neural processing in the cochlea and auditory nerve; the experience of sound (loudness, pitch, timbre); perception of simple tones and complex sound; models such as Bekesy's Place Theory; localization of sound. \n- Touch and pain: The cutaneous stimulus; the skin and its different receptor systems; active versus passive touch; pain and pain relief, such as analgesia and endogenous opiates, placebo. \n- Smell and taste: The olfactory stimulus, the olfactory system, the taste stimulus, the taste system; pheromones; taste quality; flavor.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

Decision making and decision theory are broad and complex areas of great theoretical interest and practical impact in almost all today\u0092s disciplines ranging from biology and neuroscience to computer science, economics, marketing, mathematics, political sciences, psychology to sociology or statistics. In some of these disciplines decision making has been studied for more than two centuries. \nThe focus in this lecture lies on individual decision making. The students learn about basic concepts of decision making, theories of decision making, methods to elicits values/utilities, importance weights/probabilities and shall be able to conduct a decision analysis. New directions in decision making research complement the course. Specifically, the following topics are addressed: \n\u0095 Elements of decision problems: Values, objectives, sequential decisions, uncertain events, consequences \n\u0095 Models of problem structure: Fundamental and means objectives, influence diagrams, decision trees \n\u0095 Models of uncertainty: probability and its assessment, judgments, heuristics and biases, accuracy , calibration \n\u0095 Models of preference: expected utility theory, prospect theory, models for decision making under certainty, heuristics \n\u0095 Decision analysis: Value/utility measurement, probability/ weight measurement, Multiattribute Utility Theory (MAUT), conjoint analysis, sensitivity analysis \n\u0095 Specific topics such as neuroeconomics, decision making in medicine and new approaches in the field of decision making", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

Emotion and motivation interface with almost all areas of psychology and are also highly relevant in connected domains. Terms such as emotion, mood, temperament, but also motivation are often used in ways that reflect our layman's understanding of these phenomena, but that does not take into account the extensive history of scientific research into these concepts. \nThis course explores the history and tradition of scientific research on emotion and motivation. The course is to provide students with a solid understanding of the competing theoretical approaches at different levels, ranging from biological and neuroscience approaches to social and cultural concepts. In consequence the successful participants shall have the foundations required to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of applying such concepts various contexts, including in empirical research as well as in various applications. Lastly, they shall be informed of current debates and trends in emotion and motivation research. \nMajor theoretical approaches will be presented for emotion and for motivation. In each case there will be an emphasis on critical analysis and discussion of the premises and inconsistencies of the theories in the light of empirical data. The work of specific researchers or specific methods (e.g., measurement of facial activity) will be pursued in more depth. \n \nMajor theoretical approaches to emotions: \n \n- Darwinian perspective on emotions. \n- Evolutionary basis of emotions and their expressions: Jamesian Perspective of emotion. \n- Function of physiological changes associated with emotion: Cannon critique of specificity of physiological patterning; mixed models, specifically the Schachter-Singer theory of emotion and associated concepts, such as excitation transfer. \n- Cognitive perspective of emotion: Origin of the modern appraisal construct in the approaches by Arnold and Lazarus, as well as modern multidimensional concepts of appraisal (e.g., Frijda, Smith, Scherer, Roseman); the relationship of cognition and emotion will be discussed particularly in the light of the Lazarus-Zajonc debate; multiple levels of processing. \n- Social-Constructivist Perspective: Different levels of social influence on the definition, experience, and expression of emotions will be discussed (e.g. Averill's theory); display rules, feeling rules, and social schemata of physiological responses. \n \nMajor theoretical approaches to motivation: \n \n- History of the motivation concept \n- Biological approaches: Drive concept; examples such as hunger, thirst; physiological underpinnings. \n- Behavioural approaches: Learning theory in relation to motivation (Pavlov, Thorndike, Garcia); innate vs. learned behaviour; species-characteristic stereotyped behaviour. \n- Cognition and emotion: Goals as knowledge structures \n- Motivation and social behaviour: Sociobiology, evolutionary psychology. Cultural perspectives \n- Interaction between emotion and motivation", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "6. Feb. 2014 15:45", "end": "6.

From a layperson's perspective, one might think that an attitude is a stable trait, constituting a person's personality: We know whom we love, we know what we like and this will not change that easily. Historically, this has been the point of view of early psychological research and theorizing. Social Psychological research challenged this notion by providing empirical evidence reflecting the fact that people do not read up their attitudes from an internal meter; rather, attitudes are malleable and flexible and very much dependent on the situation. Given that this is the case, the measurement of attitudes needs a scientific training. It is important to know the methods of how I can get a rather stable opinion from a person instead of a flexible utterance. On the other hand, this sensitivity to context makes it possible that attitudes can be changed. Thus, for example, undesired attitudes leading to unhealthy behaviour can be changed if one understands their nature. \nThis course covers the following specific aspects of attitude research: \n \n- Historical developments in attitude research \n- The concept of attitudes: Its cognitive, emotional and behavioural components. \n- The measurement of attitudes: Classic, explicit measures (e.g., questionnaire methods) and implicit measures (e.g., reaction time measures). \n- Situational influences on attitudes. \n- The attitude-behaviour relation: When does an attitude lead to correspondent behaviour? \n- Attitude change. \n- Applications concerning consumer behaviour, person perception, health psychology and personal development.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "7.

For instance, we sometimes buy things which we do not really need or even do not want to buy just because we fall prey to a clever advertisement or a smart salesperson. We sometimes behave in certain ways only because others around us do the same thing. Understanding when and why such things happen is the goal of this seminar. \nSocial psychologists have considered three major categories of social influence: Conformity, compliance, and obedience. Conformity involves changing one's behaviour to match the responses or actions of others, to fit in with others around. Compliance refers to the act of changing one's behaviour in response to a direct request. Obedience is a special type of compliance that involves changing one's behaviour in response to a directive from an authority figure. \nThis seminar explores direct and indirect strategies of social influence. In particular, strategies that make use of the following principles will be discussed: \n \n- The norm of reciprocation: This rule says that people should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided them. \n- Commitment and consistency: Once they make a choice or take a stand, individuals will encounter personal and interpersonal pressure to behave consistently with that commitment. \n- Social proof: People tend to view a behaviour as correct in a given situation to the degree that they see others performing it. \n- Liking: People prefer to say yes to requests of others who they know and like. \n- Authority: People sometimes obey to authority figures and do things they would never have done without the influence of authorities. \n- Scarcity: Opportunities seem more valuable when they are less available, and are, therefore more likely taken. \n \nWhile this seminar primarily focuses on theoretical explanations and basic research findings in the field of social influence, the implications for various applied settings will be discussed. These include, for instance, advertisement design and consumer behaviour, negotiations in business and oratory techniques in law settings.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "7.

During the past century, scholars have hotly debated how protest originates and spreads. Can grievance alone sustain prolonged protest? Which types of political systems facilitate or inhibit mobilization? How do activists recruit others to join their cause? These are a few of the many important questions we address in this course, particularly during the first section, when we read and discuss some of the seminal theoretical works of the field. In the second section, we examine the factors associated with social movement success or failure. Why are some movements able to initiate change, whereas other movements flounder and fail? How does government/social control shape outcomes? In the third section, we move beyond theory and analyze one of the most influential case studies in the field: the U.S. civil rights movement. At its zenith, the civil rights movement had several different \u0093wings.\u0094 We examine the ideologies and tactics of the various wings, the government\u0092s reactions, and the tensions within the broader movement. The readings include scholarly texts and works by notable civil rights leaders, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. Building on the knowledge gained during the three main sections of the course, we conclude with an examination of recent developments. We assess the impact of modern communication technologies on protest and the role of social movements in a variety of the major issues confronting us today.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

On the one hand, the course will provide the student with an overview of what public management is today, how it has changed in the past 30 or so years and where it is going. Not only will the course expose students to contemporary thinking in public management, by looking at the way public managers over the world deal with today's policy challanges, the course will also allow students to apply this knowledge to real cases. On the other hand, the course exposes students to the conceptual and methodological tool-box of contemporary policy analysis and, by drawing on real-life examples from a variety of policy domains, shows students how academic and professional policy analysts bring this tool-box to bear on issues of public management and public policy. Additionally, the course will show how different socio-cultural, political or disciplinary frames of references shape policy analysis and how policy analysts can use these frames to sharpen their understanding of the way public institutions are managed.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

The course will focus on the understanding of statistical concepts and the application of statistical techniques. While some formulae might be used, no stringent mathematical derivation will be provided. The general objective is to become an intelligent user of the various univariate and multivariate statistical techniques and to acquire the knowledge for deciding which procedure is most suitable for the given business situation. We will discuss the theoretical aspects of the statistical methods, discuss the assumptions for their use, reflect on their limitations and the controversies they create. In practical sessions we will learn how to run the particular procedures using SPSS and/or R, how to interpret the computer output and how to skillfully communicate the results of statistical analyses.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

Thus, one focus of the course consists of quantitative methods used in economy and business. We will expand on the knowledge acquired in the statistics class and intensify discussion of multiple regression analysis, in particualr with an emphasis on longitudinal/time dependent data. The second focus of the course is on the analysis of large data sets that are created during the regular business process, such as billing data, customer information, etc.; data, that is more and more analysed by computer-intensive methods to find structure and patterns. \nThe general objective is to become familiar with classic and contemporary methods that are used in econometric and business analyses and to become a critical reader of case studies in this field. We will take a practical approach to learn how to run the particular procedures in state of the art software. To foster the practical approach homeworks and projects will be assigned. By the end of this course, students will know the rules for being competent practitioners of econometrics. This involves: \nUnderstanding how data should be organized for undertaking econometric modeling and the steps required for preparing data for analysis; Recognizing what technique to select from the econometric toolkit given the pattern of values in the data; Being able to interpret results with respect to both their statistical and economic/social significance; Be able to cast a skeptical eye on econometric results in the literature; Have fun working with social science data", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "7.

These students must complete it during the first year of their BA/BSc. However, it is also open as an elective to students from other majors*. For this course students obtain 1.6 credits toward the completion of the APS module. It is an introduction to the principles and procedures of scientific inquiry. It explains how learning at the high-school level differs from learning at university level, and how scientific research differs from everyday sense making. It gives students a broad overview of alternative research strategies and trains them in basic scientific work and learning skills, such as using the Jacobs University Information Resource Center, retrieving and organizing information, and citing correctly.
