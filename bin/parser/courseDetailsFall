Students will learn about inter- and intraindividual differences in biological, psychological, and social aging, how adaptive competencies and learning abilities develop over the lifespan and how adaptation to internal and external factors allows healthy and successful aging. Also different types of interventions for enabling successful aging will be discussed. We will always focus on neurobiological and behavior results as well as on the development of brain and body.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "3. Sep. 2014 08:15", "end": "3.

The seminar addresses a major problem, and open question in transdisciplinary research, namely the relation and connection between visuals, their perception, reception, interpretation, but also their production, and empathy as a (not only) human capacity to connect to others, to identify, but also to distinguish oneself from others. There are strong indications from various disciplines \u0096 philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, biology, neuroscience, media and communication, art history as well as applied therapy and visual design that there is an intrinsic connection between the sense of seeing/vision, and an empathetic or apathetic reaction to these visuals. The course explores this connection and its consequences from transdisciplinary perspectives with the aim of developing transdisciplinary research projects in research teams in the area of \u0093Visual Empathy\u0094.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

The counter-intuitive behavior \ncomes from nonlinear interactions between the system components and the nonlinear processing \nof incoming information. This course is an introduction to nonlinear dynamics and control \nwith a focus on a broad range of applications. Topics include: \n1. Low dimensional autonomous dynamical systems: formulation as differential equation, \nflow, fixed points, stability, stability criteria, potentials and Lyapunov functionals, simple local \nbifurcations (saddle-node, pitchfork, transcritical, cusp, Hopf), simple numerical schemes, \ntime-discrete maps (fixed points, stability), introduction to chaos. \n2. Control for linear systems: general matrix-based solution for driven linear ODEs, reachability, \ncontrollability, observability, Gram-matrix for determining control laws and for reconstruction, \nlinear-state feedback controller, stable-state estimation, introduction to optimal control. \n3. Reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (activator-inhibitor, relations to control), \nstability of stationary solutions, Turing instability.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

Such systems can either be fabricated in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) using very high scale integration (VLSI) techniques or implemented in programmable devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In both cases, very large designs are partitioned into a hierarchy of logical blocks, and by adhering to a set of standard design rules, the difficulty of integrating these blocks is dramatically reduced. The most popular approach is synchronous design with register transfer level (RTL) logic, but asynchronous designs are also possible. \n \nAlthough digital systems were traditionally designed at the schematic level, the current trend is towards hardware description languages (HDLs) that allow compact description of very complex hardware constructs. The appearance of sophisticated automatic hardware synthesis engines that implement logic directly from HDL have made HDLs the choice for new logic designs. Although the target language of this class is VHDL, other languages such as Verilog and SystemC apply the same design strategies. This course stresses the importance of viewing HDL as a way of describing real hardware, and not \"just another programming language\".", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

An example is the ``world model'' of a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its environment -- needed, for instance, for navigation. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings, from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech recognition systems. There is a large number of formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally large diversity of learning algorithms. However, there is a relatively small number of fundamental challenges which are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms: most notably, the ``curse of dimensionality'' and the almost deadly-dangerous problem of under- vs.\\ overfitting. This lecture introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, mixtures of Gaussians, Parzen windows). Furthermore, the course also provides an intense refresher of the requisite concepts from probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

Antennas are used in many different applications, where mobile communication is only one, although, one of the most important ones. In many cases it is the antenna that causes some trouble (dysfunction, disconnection, etc.) if not properly designed and realized (maybe you remember the trouble with Apple's iPhone 4 antenna in 2010). Therefore, engineers who are working in the wireless business have to know about the working principles of antennas. \nThe course is organized as follows. After an introduction (chapter 1) we will recapitulate the Maxwell's Equations (chapter 2) and the basics of electromagnetic waves and their main characteristics. \nThese topics are foundational for understanding antenna theory. In chapter 4 the basic method for dealing with antenna problems is introduced which is the method of vector potentials calculated by a given antenna current that causes radiation in the transmit mode (or that is induced if the antenna is receiving). The Hertzian dipole and the electrically small loop antenna (i.e., a magnetic \ndipole) are calculated as the very first and very basic antennas. After that, the most important terms and definitions are introduced, i.e., radiation characteristic (beam pattern), directivity, gain, efficiency, path loss, half power beamwidth, and EIRP. In chapter 5 we calculate linear antennas, here, dipole antennas of different electrical lengths. Chapter 6 is devoted to array antennas and the calculation of the array factor. Exemplarily, different array configurations consisting of half-wavelength dipoles are considered. This deepens the understanding of how beamforming, nulling, etc. \ncan be realized by so called phased array antennas. \nIn chapter 7 aperture antennas are discussed. For that, the method of equivalent sources is introduced. This theory is then applied to horn antennas and slot antennas followed by parabolic reflector antennas and lens antennas. \nFinally, microstrip patch antennas and patch antenna arrays are investigated.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

An example is the ``world model'' of a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its environment -- needed, for instance, for navigation. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings, from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech recognition systems. There is a large number of formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally large diversity of learning algorithms. However, there is a relatively small number of fundamental challenges which are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms: most notably, the ``curse of dimensionality'' and the almost deadly-dangerous problem of under- vs.\\ overfitting. This lecture introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, mixtures of Gaussians, Parzen windows). Furthermore, the course also provides an intense refresher of the requisite concepts from probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "4.

Biological (e.g. genetic) and contextual (e.g. experience) influences on brain development over the lifespan are addressed. Plasticity of the brain across the lifespan is emphasized. Plasticity is the ability of the nervous system to respond to changed demands and, thus, underlies learning and adaptive behavior. Development of the cerebral cortex and behavioral outcomes are explored in the context of environmental effects that can amplify or inhibit adaptive capacity. Neural malleability is maximal in early development, but the capacity for change in the nervous system is maintained throughout life including old age. Normal age development of the brain is contrasted to pathological changes that appear in some diseases of old age. Consequences of normal and non-normal development and aging and the influence of lifestyle factors (e.g., a physically active lifestyle, continued education) are discussed. Students will leave the course with an understanding of brain-behavior-environment interactions in lifespan developmental outcomes. Students will train their research, presentation and writing skills by critically evaluating scientific evidence.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "2. Sep. 2014 11:15", "end": "2.

The remaining 20% will be based on regular participation in the discussions, quality of contributions, and class attendance (missing more than two classes without valid excuse will lead to deductions). \n \nCourse presentations (1-2) on research papers related to the course matters and mandatory readings of the respective class will be given by each student at some point during the semester. The presentations will summarize the introduction, methods, results and critically evaluate a scientific paper assigned to you (15 minutes in total). The following discussion will be led by the presenter. Each student in the auditorium should prepare 2-3 questions/comments for the discussion in advance. For one or two classes written home work will be requested. More details will be given in class and alternative formats might be offered. \n \nFor the research project, you will do a literature search on a self-defined topic, write a brief report, and present your findings in class. More information about formal requirements and procedures will be announced during the course. The report will be submitted via Turnitin for check of plagiarism. Any violation of the Code of Academic Integrity will lead to a fail. \n \nQuizzes will be in the form of multiple-choice or true/false questions and given at the beginning of a course. If you are late and miss the quiz, all questions will be counted as \u0093false\u0094. About 5 quizzes will be distributed during the semester and they will be graded in total. \n \nActive participation in class includes, for example, discussion of lectures and presentations on basis of pre-formulated questions, application of presented concepts to real-life situations, or other transfer activities. \n \nStudents may earn extra credit for the course by participating in research opportunities announced in class or by other means. Research opportunities must be approved by the instructor in order to count toward extra credit. Once the student participates, it is each student\u0092s responsibility to notify the instructor of his/her participation in these projects immediately after his/her participation (one/two days) even if researchers say they will notify the instructor.

The increasing amount of biological data in particular \nof protein and DNA sequences requires students to gain practical experience with algorithms \nand computational tools for sequence analysis. The lab course intends to train students in \nthe application of computational approaches to nucleic acid and protein sequence analysis and \nsecondary structure prediction. The script language Perl will be introduced and students will \nbe trained to write own applications and to program bioinformatics algorithms and methods. It \nwill give a practical introduction and an overview on available and frequently applied sequence \nanalysis methods including the software to align and compare sequences and to predict coding \nand non-coding regions. Multiple alignment methods will be used to align several sequences \nand to identify conserved elements. In addition, computational methods for the prediction of \nprotein and RNA secondary structure will be introduced and applied to selected examples. The \ngeneration of a SQL data base in combination with a script language will be introduced. \nPart 2: Genomics. In the second part of the lab course (Genomics) hands on in genome \nanalysis will be obtained. Starting with a students seminar on a special topic related to genome \nresearch every week, several tools will be tested and used for sequence analysis. We will use \nweb-bases systems as well as standalone tools installed on a local server. Complete genomes as \nwell as genomic fragments will be analysed. The genomic fragments will serve as the template \nfor in depth annotation using an open source annotation system (GenDB). A local installation \nof the phylogenetic software package ARB will be used for phylogenetic inference and tree \nreconstruction of selected functional genes.", "Credits": "7.50", "Appointments": [{"start": "27.

HTS is a main selective tool in big-scale research programs like drug discovery. Methods of HTS are basically methods of analytical biochemistry (photometry, purification, electrophoresis, kinetic assay, radioisotopes, immunoassay, descriptive statistics, regression analysis, etc), that is why HTS course explicitly covers these subjects, because firm knowledge of methods of analytical biochemistry is crucially important for assay design, its validation, and following data analysis and decision making. During the course we also will learn principles of the various detection techniques (light absorption, fluorescence, readioisotope technique). Consequently, the pivot part of the HTS is assay design, where detection techniques are one of the essential parts, and following statistical treatment of the results will lead to making of the decision. Also we will learn physical principles and operational basics of many analytical biochemical instruments used for multi-sample analysis (microplate readers, scintillation counters) as well as consumables for the HTS. In this course we will cover state of the art technologies including automated liquid handling machines (robots) and techniques used in HTS. A focus will be on genetic engineering techniques and screening systems involved. Additionally required automation and engineering approaches will be covered in detail. The goal is to \nprovide students with a background that enables them to successfully implement HTS strategies in real world applications of high-tech industry by mining the created diversity and finding the needle in haystack.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

It is the fundamental basis of applied biotechnology when it is applied to and used to study processes in the natural environment. Environmental Biotechnology could also imply that one try to harness biological process for commercial uses and exploitation. The growing concern over the quality of our environment demands prevention of polluting releases in the ecosystem and treatment of pollutants already there. The lecture course will deal with aerobic and anaerobic treatment of waste water. The most important part a waste-water cleaning plant is the biological part. During several hours of stay a considerable part of the pollution is removed by bacteria and the BOD5 (biological oxygen demand) is reduced by 85 to 95% during the waste-water treatment. Modern waste-water treatment plants do a good job for the removal of the organic matter. The problem nowadays is the removal of nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate) and phosphate from waste-water. The essential processes are nitrification (i.e. oxidation of ammonia to nitrate) and denitrification (i.e. the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen). These processes cannot proceed at the same time or in the same place because nitrification needs high oxygen concentration (oxygen concentration above 2mg/l) whereas denitrification needs anaerobic condition (oxygen concentration lower than 0.1 mg/l). All the different aerobic and anaerobic biological processes that are involved in the elimination of organic pollution from waste water and soil will be discussed in the course.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

This course tends to reach a better understanding on how eukaryotic cells interact with each other in order to form tissues that make up organs such as e.g. the heart, intestine, kidney, liver or the thyroid gland. The focus of the course will be on cellular differentiation to distinct types of cells and their integration into certain organs thereby enabling and maintaining life of an organism. As the course deals with physiology of eukaryotic cells, we will also have to include pathophysiology by discussing common and rare diseases afflicting our body's organs and cells. \nThe course will be held in an interactive lecture style with active participation of the Students. The course material will comprise a selection of textbooks, review articles and original research papers dealing with cells and their function in tissues and organs. Students will contribute by presenting research papers of their own choice or following the suggestions of the Instructor. Student presentations will be included into the respective lecture topics as talks or posters. In depth discussions of specific topics is expected from this as well as related courses in this specialization area (see Handbook for a comprehensive list of our offers).

Project Management is of overwhelming relevance for global economies, esp. those who develop rapidly by innovative processes. Projects could be undertaken at all organizational levels, i.e. involving single persons, a single as well as multiple organizational units and it is relevant to all kinds of industries such as especially logistics that focuses on quantitative, qualitative, spatial and time-related aspects itself. For Logistics, one on the winners of global dynamics, project management also creates the framework for organizational flexibility and ability to adapt to change. In research and practice, project management is of increasing importance and correspondingly accepted to balance the competing project constraints of scope, quality, schedule, budget, resources and risk. (PROJECT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE (2008)). On the individual level, project management knowledge can be considered to be one of the basic skills today. \n \nAim of the Course: \nIn this course, students will learn the theoretical, strategic and practical aspects of international project management on a highly standardized level. The transfer will be guaranteed by sequentally writing a project handbook following a process model including methods and tools for project leaders. \n \nLearning Outcome: \nStudents will \u00eddentify the relevance of international standardized project managament, the different steps to implement, plan, steer and finish a project, to manage esp. risks and opportunities, identify the relevance and influence of stakeholders and environmental and the importance of continuos tracking and learning. Since project management is always team work, students will also form teams and evaluate the success factors of horizontal cooperation. \n \nCurriculum: \n1. Project and Project Management (basic definitions) \n2. Management by Projects \n3. Strategic aspects of multi project management (portfolios) \n4.

During the past half a century, logistics has emerged from a set of issues discussed within the marketing field to a scientific discipline on its own mainly because of its high relevance to practice. Logistics deals with the economic networks and the related flows of goods, people, money and information. Logistics discipline is of eclectic nature. As a result, logistics requires methods and tools, insights and experiences from multiple disciplines in order to provide a holistic view for the complex problems arising from the real-world. Among the marketing and military science, logistics works together with fields such as economic, computer science, mathematics, psychology, biology and strategic management. \nFor students pursuing a master of science in International Logistics it is crucial to understand the discipline of logistics and its characteristics, as well as its transdisciplinary influences. Therefore, this course aims at introducing the students to logistics as a scientific, academic discipline. In this manner, the course will introduce numerous scientific methods and approaches in general and their applicability for logistics in particular. Moreover, this course focuses on the development of research and writing skills necessary for successfully managing an advanced course of studies in Logistics on one side and contributing to the research discourse of Logistics on the other side. In fact, Scientific Skills are essential not only in the logistics academic world, but in today\u0092s highly complex world where we have to process reliable and well-founded information constantly, therefore, in the professional world. To be able to manage daily business, it is crucial to be informed and to possess the best tools to extract information from a variety of sources. Skills to produce a variety of texts for different academic and professional assignments are of equal importance. \n \nSpecific topics and issues covered include: \n? Academic sources, referencing, in-text quotations, bibliography, Academic English features, avoiding unintentional plagiarism and academic integrity issues; \n? Reading and writing (topic selection, research question formulation, summarizing and result-oriented reporting, scientific structure, norms and vocabulary); \n? Various approaches to research (analytical versus empirical types of theory building approaches, various aspects of research methodologies such as sample size, timeframe, data analysis and data selection, issues related to various methodological approaches); \n? Research in logistics (main topics and their practical relevance, important academic journals and conferences) \n \nThis course is based on lectures, group work, and self-study components. Students will deliver presentations, posters and written assignments and a feedback loop will be in place through individual appointments. Students will be introduced to research resources available at Jacobs University Bremen\u0092s Information Resource Center (IRC) and then asked to search for their own academic materials to prepare presentations, posters and written assignments. Therefore, the key learning of this course includes the scientific skills required to succeed in this master of science degree in Logistics as well as in the professional world, during one\u0092s career. \n \nLearning Outcomes \n\u0095 Be able to logically structure an essay, a presentation or poster \n\u0095 Prepare a bibliography, avoid unintentional plagiarism and get used to the code of academic integrity. \n\u0095 Be able to deal with huge amounts of texts and information in a fast and efficient manner \n\u0095 Getting used to approaches and methods used within research and academia, particularly for logistics and supply chain management \n \nTeaching Methods \nThis course will utilize introductory lectures, guided self-study of texts, presentations, group and class discussion, and \u0096 in particular \u0096 readings.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

At the same \ntime, the content is chosen so that students arrive quickly at central concepts which are used in \nessentially all mathematics courses, and which are needed in the exact sciences. \nThe Analysis sequence begins with a quick review of natural, rational and real numbers \n(which are assumed as known), and introduces the field of complex numbers. The axiom of \ncompleteness distinguishes the real numbers from the rationals and marks the beginning of \nAnalysis. The complex exponential and trigonometric functions are defined. \nMetric spaces are introduced and used to define continuity and convergence in a general \nframework. The Bolzano-Weierstra\u00df and the Heine-Borel theorems are proved. The intermediate \nand maximal value theorems for functions on the real line are discussed as consequences \nof connectedness and compactness on metric spaces. Sequences of functions are discussed, in \nparticular uniform convergence, as well as the continuity, differentiability, integrability of the \nlimit function. \nDifferentiability of functions on the real line is introduced. The mean value theorem and \nTaylor\u0092s theorem is discussed. \nThe Riemann integral in one variable is introduced. The relation between the derivative and \nthe integral, i.e., the fundamental theorem of calculus is proved. \nThis course has no formal prerequisites; incoming students with a strong mathematics background \nare encouraged to take this class in their first semester.

It \nintroduces vector spaces and linear maps, which play an important role throughout mathematics \nand its applications. \nThe course begins by introducing the concept of a vector space over an arbitrary field (for \nexample, the real or complex numbers) and the concept of linear independence, leading to the \nnotion of \u0093dimension\u0094. We proceed to define linear maps between vector spaces and discuss \nproperties such as nullity and rank. Linear maps can be represented by matrices and we show \nhow matrices can be used to compute ranks and kernels of linear maps or to solve linear systems \nof equations. \nIn order to study some geometric problems and talk about lengths and angles, we introduce \nan additional structure called the inner or scalar product on real vector spaces. Properties \nof Euclidean vector spaces and orthogonal maps are treated, including the Cauchy-Schwarz \ninequality, Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization and orthogonal and unitary groups. \nAn endomorphism is a linear map from a vector space to itself and is represented by a \nsquare matrix. We study the trace and determinant of endomorphisms and matrices and discuss \neigenvalues and eigenvectors. We discuss the question whether a matrix is diagonalizable and \nstate the theorem on Jordan Normal Form which provides a classification of endomorphisms. \nThis course has no formal prerequisites; incoming students with a strong mathematics background \nare encouraged to take this class in their first semester. However, a familiarity with \nmathematical reasoning and proof (e.g. proof by induction or by contradiction), such as introduced \nin General Mathematics and Computational Science I, is required.", "Credits": "7.50", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

Research of this type has not only resulted in a better understanding of physics, but has also led to new, important developments in mathematics. The converse is also true with mathematicians' contributions being more often of a bottom-up nature, i.e., deriving results starting from a mathematical foundation. In the lectures of this course certain of the mathematical foundations of mathematical physics will be presented. They will of course be motivated by problems from physics and applications to physics will be given following the bottom-up principle. \nFor example, the basics of modern symplectic geometry will be presented and as a consequence fundamental results in classical mechanics will be proved. Quantum mechanics will be built on the foundation of the theory of group representations which uses important methods from geometry and analysis. In this context basic tools involving, e. g. tensor calculus and the spectral theory for operators such as Laplacians, will be presented. Guage theories will be discussed from the viewpoint of fiber bundles. Asymptotic analysis in certain interesting geometric and random matrix contexts will lead to results in semiclassical physics. \n \nThe course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students of Mathematics and Physics. The only prerequisite for the course is a background in basic analysis and linear algebra. All concepts and relevant methods will be explained starting from these minimal prerequisites.

The course content is transdisciplinary and is divided into three modules: \n \n(1) Earth Surface System: The \"Critical Zone\" is the complex near-surface environment in which interactions between rock, soil, water, air and living organisms define the natural habitat and control the availability of live-sustaining resources. In this module, participants will be introduced in a qualitative way to the basic components of and fundamental processes operating in the critical zone. \n \n(2) Human Interaction with the Environment: It will be demonstrated how physical, chemical and biological processes interact in the geological environment and drive the functions of the ecosystem, and how human activities interfere with these natural processes. Anthropogenic changes in the ecosystem at local and global scales will be discussed, with emphasis on the degradation of the atmosphere, freshwater systems, soils, forests, grassland and cropland and the changes of polar and coastal regions. Strategies are proposed for controlling environment degradation from extraction and consumption of Earth resources and for maintaining a healthful and sustainable earth. \n \n(3) Earth, Energy and Sustainability: \"Energy\" is a multi-dimensional topic that provides several vantage points for understanding sustainability issues. Conventional energy is sourced from the earth, which causes environmental degradation, and energy use is the primary cause of greenhouse gases and climate change. Nonetheless, energy is crucial for development. The challenge is sourcing and using it in a sustainable manner. In this module, students will learn about the sustainability movement, climate change and basic energy facts.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "3. Sep. 2014 08:15", "end": "3.

Nutrient cycling will be described as an emergent property of these fundamental processes. Fascinating aspects such as the reasons why a biosphere based on a single species with no nutrient cycling is very unlikely to exist or the possibility that feedbacks between organisms and their environment have helped to maintain habitable conditions on Earth will be explored. By studying the fundamental processes governing the ecology of our planet one can gain a deep understanding of its functioning from an Earth system perspective.

While, for example, the very nature of physics is to express relationsships between physical quantities in mathematical terms, an analytic solution of the resulting formulars is often not available. Instead, numerical solutions based on computer programs are required to obtain useful results for real-life problems. During this course different numerical techniques are introduced such as integration, interpolation, root finding, and solving differential equations which are important tools in any numerical approach. These methods will be applied to a selection of problems including the classical dynamics of particles, traffic simulations, simple electrostatics, random processes, etc. Since the course includes numerous examples and exercises for programming codes, some programming skills in C, Fortran or Python are strongly recommended as prerequisites.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

An overview is given on sedimentological and (bio)geochemical processes that determine the geologic record. The course will first focus on sedimentological processes like erosion, transportation and deposition of particles in estuarine, beach, continental shelf and slope, and deep sea environments. It will lead to a better understanding of basic processes, such as tides, wind stress, topographic effects on turbulence, and exchange flow. The vertical and horizontal mixing and residence times of particles important to biological and geological processes will be discussed. The goal of biogeochemical oceanography is to understand what controls the abundances, kinds, and temporal variations of organisms in the sea, which are related tothe flow of organic matter. Progress toward this goal usually entails identifying the patterns of variability in space and time, determining the processes producing and maintaining the patterns, then quantifying the processes. The path to predictive understanding of biogeochemical processes leads into physical, chemical, or geological oceanography.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "1.

Organocatalysis is now a third option, providing competitive, as well as complementary, solutions for the synthesis of diastereo- and enantioenriched pharmaceutical drugs and natural products. The underlying premise is that low molecular weight chiral organic molecules can be designed and employed for the catalytic activation of achiral starting materials culminating in asymmetric bond formation. The catalysis concepts originate from Bronsted acid and base chemistry and rely heavily on covalent activation and/or strong chiral counter ion effects. When bifunctional organocatalysts are used, weaker (noncovalent) attractive forces (notably hydrogen bonding) become important. Incorporation of these concepts into small all organic catalysts that fine-tuned with the required steric and electronic features allow chemists to control the trajectory, facial approach, and conformation of reacting chemical partners. Students interested in this course will also feel comfortable with the basics of enzymatic pathways (biochemistry), and the overarching principles noted in the first year of organic chemistry. The course will strengthen and expand on those foundations to allow a clearer picture of the critical stereocontrol elements required for natural product synthesis and by extension pharmaceutical drugs.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

It discusses basic methods commonly used by physicists, chemists, and life scienctists to characterize molecular systems of interest. It starts with a general introduction to basic interactions between atoms and molecules and their environment, needed to understand the working principles of experimental techniques. The main part focusses on the individual experimental technique including X-ray diffraction, NMR, mass spectrometry, optical spectroscopy, microscopy, light scattering, calorimetry and electrochemistry. Some basic concepts from physics and physical chemistry and a certain basic mathematical background are necessary to understand the working principle of the different instruments. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we will discuss the theoretical background and application of the different methods, complemented by visits of Jacobs research labs using those analytical instruments. \nThe course serves as an introductory course to analytical techniques for MSc students. It can also serve as a specialization for 3rd year undergraduate students in physics, chemistry, or other majors interested in an overview of modern experimental techniques in physical chemistry, biophysics, analytical chemistry or mateial science.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "1.

At the same time, the United States, as the only remaining \"super-power\" in the 21st century and as the leader in defining the world's popular culture, has an impact on the past and present of all other world region's that needs to be explained and understood. A third rationale for this course is the American model of education around which IUB is built; hence, a deeper understanding of American culture is expected to be part of the history students' education. - As a lecture, this course provides an overview of North American history from pre-Columbian beginnings to the late twentieth century. Students will be introduced to the major themes and problems in British colonial America, and in the national history of the United States; at the same time, they learn about interpretations and historiographical concepts relating to American history (e.g., \"American exceptionalism\"). Besides providing the students with this basic knowledge and understanding, the course may approach American history with an emphasis on a particular problem or perspective (e.g., \"democracy\", \"race relations and multicultural society\", \"America in the world\").", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

Topics include the transformation of Ancien R\u00e9gimes and revolutionary change; the emergence of industrial societies and economies; the formation of nation-states and empire-building, modern political ideologies such as liberalism, nationalism, or socialism; war, dictatorship and the European dimensions of the Holocaust; post-war prosperity and environmental changes.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "3.

Religions of this type emerged, when prophets rejected given social norms and propagated new values. Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism established a split between an existing social reality and a sacred and just order. The religious institutions of temple and synagogue, of church and sects, of mosques, orders, and temples preserved and transmitted that message; a corpus of sacred texts became the source for practical attitudes to the world; a class of learned authorities was responsible for their interpretation. \nThis legacy shaped these religions in the modern age. Constitutive to a modern culture is an interior rift. While the present age is seen as superior to past and foreign cultures with regard to technology and science, past and foreign cultures are acknowledged as preserving a value of their own. When philosophers in the age of Enlightenment levelled profound criticism against any trust in transmitted truth claims and favoured their replacement by a reasonable religion, they met opposition by other intellectuals who saw in the history of religions a manifestation of a power uncontrollable by human reason, but part of human existence. \nThe Biblical account of the redemption of Israel from the bondage in Egypt became a powerful metaphor for an enduring longing for redemption and for practical experiments with truth. New meanings of history and of nature were retrieved from the tradition that contradict secular beliefs in progress and rationality (Apocalypticism; Esotericism). In Judaism Messianism, Kabbalah, and Hasidism established forms of religiosity that had an impact on the culture and politics of modern Israel. Christianity developed out of Jewish Messianism and taught from its very beginning diverse paths of redemption from an irrational world. Islam emerged as a religion of a sacred community dedicated to common ritual practices and mutual solidarity. When the transmitted Islamic order collapsed under the impact of Western colonialism, new leaders emerged and turned a habitus of quietism into an active subjective religiosity e.g. Islamism, Jihadism, Salafism. Western colonialism likewise challenged Hinduism that became a religion of its own only in the 19th century, though its heritage derived from earliest times. Typical to modern Hinduism are the Bhagavad-Gita and Mohandas Ghandi\u0092s practice of non-violent resistance against Colonialism. These new forms of religiosity derive their persuasive power from their ability to define the situation of human beings in the modern world.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "2.

The dynamics of globalization and migration creates multicultural and multilingual situations with specific tensions, problems and chances. Especially the national states with their monocultural and monolingual traditions face radically new social challenges which are discussed in theories of multiculturalism. Tensions arise between the old national languages (and the traditional regional languages), the languages of the immigrants and the new global language English: What language shall be used in public education, what shall be the position of the languages of the migrants in the public life of the states? What is the role of global English in these transformations? Is the spread of global English a case of linguistic imperialism, is it responsible for the death of languages, does it create a new aristocracy in the European countries? How does the European Union deal with the plurality of its languages? The course sheds light on these processes and tensions as mirrored in literature. It examines how multilingual authors have become a constitutive part of the literary scene, thus reshaping the concept and scope of literature, and in which way the regional and culturally homogenous mode of literary production is challenged by a global type of discourse and practice.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

Drawing on art history, anthropology, material culture and cultural heritage studies, and examining case studies from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania, it takes a critical look at the different approaches to the world\u0092s artistic heritage, its production and reception. It explores how world art has been collected, traded, and displayed, and addresses the economic and political interests that have long imposed conflicting aesthetic agendas on the artefacts in question. Furthermore, the course investigates some of the challenges faced by world art today and provides insight into new interdisciplinary conceptualizations of world art studies which involve a broad range of disciplines from the natural sciences and engineering to the cultural and political sciences.

It stresses the differences between the main sources of international law (article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice), always in relations to judgements of international courts, national courts or even arbitral awards. It discusses the general principles of international law in relations to the North Sea Continental Shelf Case (Federal Republic of Germany vs. Denmark and the Netherlands) and the case of the diversion of water from the river Meuse (Netherlands vs. Belgium). The relations between international law and municipal law give rise to questions according to cases of the European Court of Human Rights and of the German Federal Constitutional Court. The subjects of international law are discussed focusing on the qualification of States as a subject of International Law according to the Montevideo Convention and on recent questions like that of failed States (e.g. Somalia) or on situations near to secession (e.g. Kosovo, Transnistria, Ossetia etc.) The principle of self-determination in the UN-Charta has played a major role in the formation of newly independent States and has influenced the development of the rules on state-succession. Beside States, international organizations and recently the individual are playing a more and more prominent role as subjects of international law. How can the position of the individual as a subject of international law be justified and what is its status in the field of human rights? \n \nThe course focuses also on territory as an important element of the notion of State besides the population and state authority and sovereignty. Transfer of territory is as well discussed as the importance of discovery as a title to territory. Another chapter of the course deals with land boundaries and other boundaries and the extent of state jurisdiction (the Lotus-case and the case concerning the arrest warrant by a Belgium judge for the congolese foreign minister (Democratic Republic of Congo vs. Belgium). State immunity has undergone a very rapid recent development which is explained in relation to quite a number of cases. \n \nAnother chapter deals with the law of the sea and of state responsibility, the treatment of aliens and the protection of property, the law of treaties and the development of human rights. A chapter of the course is devoted to the use of force by States, the problem of intervention and the limitations of self-defence. The concluding chapter deals with judicial control and protection by international and national courts and makes the students familiar with the techniques of legal argumentation.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "9.

From a Cognitive Science perspective, the study of cognition typically is construed as the search for those aspects of mental experience that are uniformly true for all. In fact for much of the 20th century most psychologists assumed that all normal human beings were equipped with the same set of attentional, perceptual, memorial, learning, and inferential procedures. From a Cultural Studies perspective, there is no avoiding the cultural framework within which individuals think and act. The idea of universal mental experiences is often rejected outright by many cultural theorists; every human thought and perception is uniquely situated within a very specific framework informed by history, tradition, language, social context, etc. The goal of this seminar is to explore the dynamic of both perspectives by asking which aspects of human thinking and judgment are universally the same or culturally shaped. \nIn particular the following issues and questions will be addressed: \n \n- Definitions of culture and dimensions of cultural comparisons \n- Methodological challenges of studying culture's influences \n- Culture and systems of thought: Analytic versus holistic thinking \n- Causal attribution across cultures: How fundamental is the fundamental attribution error? \n- Cultural differences in reasoning: Western logic versus Eastern dialectics \n- The self-concept in a cross-cultural perspective: Independent versus interdependent self-construals \n- Culture and context: How flexible are cross-cultural variations in self-construals? \n- Does thinking about the self influence thinking in general? \n- Direct versus indirect communication in different cultures \n- Characteristics of cross-cultural interaction: Working in multi-cultural teams \n- Intercultural trainings \n \nThis seminar provides an introduction to important theoretical approaches from both Cognitive and Social Psychology as well as from adjacent other disciplines, like Anthropology or Ethnology. The discussed research findings may, however, help to improve cross-cultural interaction in many applied fields.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "5. Sep. 2014 09:45", "end": "5.

In other words, our feelings, thoughts and behaviour are very much influenced by typical contextual factors such as the living environment, the social structure, or the political sphere, to name a few. However, context also refers to other factors that influence how an object or a person is perceived, such as the mood, the expectations, the needs and the prior knowledge of a perceiver. Other Social Psychology issues of interest include how people interact, how inter-group conflict can be understood, and when people help each other or aggress against each other. \nThis lecture will review important aspects of social psychological research, which then will be discussed in more detail in 2nd and 3rd year seminars. These aspects include: \n \n- History of Social Psychology: A brief history of the origins of Psychology and the development of Social Psychology as an own discipline. \n- Basic concepts and methods of Social Psychology \n- Classic theories: Attribution theory, dissonance theory, and self perception theory, etc. \n- Person perception and social encoding: Which features are salient and which drive our evaluation? What affects our attitudes and our evaluation of people? \n- Person memory: Which information is remembered? \n- Stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination: The concept of stereotypes and their consequences. How can stereotypes be changed? \n- Social inference: How do judgments and decisions change according to the social contexts? Heuristics and biases. Bad and good decision-making. \n- Automatic social cognition: Basic concepts, theories, and experiments on the ongoing consciousness debate. Are all our judgments malleable? Is most of our behaviour produced unintentionally? \n- Inter-group conflict and behaviour: How can inter-group conflict be understood and resolved? What produces it? How can it be prevented? \n- Social Identity and the self: How can the self be understood from a social psychological perspective? \n- Communication: Theories of communication. Group work and group performance. Communication problems. \n- Mood: Social Psychological theories of mood. The influences of mood on cognition. The influence of cognition on mood. Mood and behaviour. \n- Motivation: Theories of needs and goals. Behaviour in the social context. Achievement motivation.

These complex social psychological phenomena involve basic cognitive and affective processes in individuals as much as processes related to group norms, intergroup relations, and social construction in a given socio-cultural context. \nThe course covers the conceptualization and measurement of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination and, with consideration of multiple levels of analysis, their various sources as well as approaches to combating them. More specifically, the topics covered in the course include: \n \n-Prevalence of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination in society (e.g. at the workplace, in education); cultural differences \n-The target's perspective: consequences of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. stereotype threat, self-fulfilling prophecy) \n-History of research on stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination \n-Research methods and measurement of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. implicit and explicit measures, old-fashioned and modern racism/sexism) \n-Levels of analysis and different theoretical approaches (e.g. social cognition, social norms and identities, inter-group conflict) \n-The mental representation of stereotypes: person memory (schema, prototype, exemplar models), models of stereotype change \n-Cognitive and affective factors involved in stereotype activation and application (e.g. social categorization, automaticity, mood, motivation, self-esteem) \n-Individual differences in stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (e.g. personality, authoritarianism, social dominance orientation) \n-Social identity: the role of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination for group identity \n-Intergroup relations: how stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination depend on the relations between groups in society (e.g. competition for resources, intergroup threats) \n-Strategies to combat stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (stereotype suppression, contact hypothesis, Jigsaw classrooms, political correctness norms, collective action, societal and legal changes.)", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.

In this course, you learn to distinguish wicked from tame environmental problems, and gain insight into the policies and institutions with which wicked environmental issues can be successfully resolved. In the process, you come to understand the alternative views of time, space, risk, nature, human nature, technology and democracy that stakeholders in debates about wicked environmental problems believe in. You are also introduced to a leading social theory with which to better understand these issues. Examples of wicked environmental problems that we look at include climate change, loss of biodiversity, Himalayan deforestation as well as the polution of the Rhine river and the Great Lakes.", "Credits": "5.00", "Appointments": [{"start": "1.

The second part considers representatives of the most important schools of thought in international ethics, commonly referred to as moral skeptics, communitarians (or statists), and cosmopolitans, and examines their ideas. Subsequently, the course focuses its attention on a range of more specific problems, each viewed from a normative perspective: the ethics of force and coercion (including intervention) in international politics; the nature, scope, and justifiability of distributive justice at the international and transnational levels (including the problem of intergenerational justice that comes into play in such issues as climate change); and the moral requirements of the global polity (including the problem of the world-state). Finally, the course looks at the possibilities of, and constraints on, transboundary ethical behavior and addresses the question of whether there is such a thing as moral progress at the international level.", "Credits": "7.50", "Appointments": [{"start": "5.
