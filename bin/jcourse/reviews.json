Be sure to understand the difference between infinities before taking the CC course. \\r\\nThis course is more mathematical and it is NOT a programming course.

The professor is one of the very best we have here at Jacobs, he is competent, reasonable, and he makes the class interesting and gives you the opportunity to play with the homework as much as you feel like it. You can also immediately see his passion about the content. Don't underestimate it though: This course will be very easy if you are into theoretical CS and abstract problems (time flies when you study about this course) but do not take it as an elective JUST because the overall workload seems to be so low.

The professor has very good teaching style, he walks you through everything, only expects you to solve problems that prove that you've understood the course material. He does NOT challenge you with problems that are unnecessarily complicated, or the kind that take ages just because of annoying computation complexity and ugly numbers.

Too many things to do for people that have thesis. It's really unnecessary to have so many components.\\r\\nDr. Hanke is interesting and she clearly puts a lot of work to make this class more interesting and entertaining.

If you are one of the many who liked the GenCS material on the first year, then you'll definitely love this one. What I loved about it:\\r\\n1. I got to really understand the theory behind parsing natural language and really see how logics are related to natural language processing. \\r\\n2. I got to think about some very interesting problems and brain teasers,\\r\\n3. This is the kind of stuff prof. Kohlhase is really excited about, so if you liked his performance in GenCS, you'll love it in ComSem.\\r\\n4. Since prof. Kohlhase could relate the material to his research, we got the chance to be exposed to problems no one else is dealing with. Although, of course, we could only contribute a certain amount, the fact that we got exposed to such interesting ideas was extremely rewarding.  Just take it, it will definitely be a rewarding experience and there's no doubt you will learn a lot.",

        "review": "--- What did you value most about this course?\\r\\nThe course material was interesting. I loved the applications of the material taught in this course. We had a nice equilibrium of theory and practice in the lecture material. I liked that we got a not that rigorous background to some nice concepts of Numerical methods.\\r\\nEven though I hated working each week for the quizzes, they kept me up to date with the material in the course. \\r\\n\\r\\n--- What would you like to see improved about this course?\\r\\nFirst: - please improve the slides. There are plenty of tools to write nice presentations (like latex). Please change the font of the text in the slides. Comic Sans is one of the worst fonts ever created. \\r\\n- The homework load was too heavy. It did not evaluate the material taught in class. They were about proving random statements that did not help us in any way to learn or understand better the material taught in class. Please revise the homework before giving it to the students. Compared to all other ESM courses offered in the last semesters, this had the worst homework experience. Plenty of homework assignments were not even possible to do without a prior knowledge in numerical software like matlab or octave. Which leads me to the next point. \\r\\n- This course may be very well complemented with the matlab lab from the math NatSciLab of GenMath. We could very well have assignments in matlab to implement some specific algorithm. If this method cannot be implemented, at least give brief descriptions of the tools that we can use. Most of the students taking this course are computer scientist. That means that most of the students would be excited about the idea of implementing an algorithm on the computer instead of doing endless calculations on paper. Please consider this. \\r\\n- Some background knowledge about concepts wouldn't hurt. Just saying. We would be more interested if we learn that some algorithm is the state of the art in some graphics problem.",

The questions were there just to test the memorizing techniques of the student. The question themselves never gave an intuitive feeling of important concepts of Software Engineering. It were just terms that were presented without any helpful meaning. \\r\\n- Maybe try to analyze different products from start to end.

The pair programming in this course is an excellent idea. But this pair programming is well run if both of the participants are on the same level. We did this in the Software Engineering course(This lab should be its implementation). During our first programming assignment we were paired explicitly to not be of the same level so that we will be \"fair\" for everyone. But that defeated the initial goal of this pair programming. \\r\\nThe problem is that the course is way to big for everyone to have a nice experience. The course should adapt in such a way it provides the best experience for everyone. Such that in the case there are too many people in the course another method of software engineering is applied like the waterfall model or another agile method. ",

Just don't expect him to do you any favours (he picks up on tiny things that other professors might give you a pass for, like sloppy referencing in PowerPoints and such), and assume that the amount of actual effort you put in will be directly reflected in your grade, i.e. if you do your presentation the night before, he will notice, and you will get a mediocre grade.",

It just didn't seem appropriate whatsoever that only a few people got outstanding marks while the rest did horribly; also, it's not entirely fair that the make up exam was the same as the regular one. (People with med excuses just re-did the test.) Also, the slides are terrible to study and understand - they are very messy and illogical. I've had to research externally and try to understand concepts myself, and I don't think that I should have to do that for some of the more simple terms or ideas in statistics. All in all, the lectures were not in line or useful to the homework assignments or the tutorials either, and it's just a very poorly structured course. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome possible recommendations: Better and more condensed slides that explain the concepts simply. More charts that compare different tests and distinctly highlight the similarities and differences/when to use which. \\r\\nAssessed lab that reflects or somewhat follows the pattern of how a homework was given, rather than something very random with concepts that were barely taught in tutorials.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's not hard to make statistics understandable or interesting; I just feel that some professors don't take the time to step back and think about how to teach their students in the most efficiently and clear way possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, the professor is wonderful and very nice - it's just the course that I didn't particularly find great.

For example:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. \"It just didn't seem appropriate whatsoever that only a few people got outstanding marks while the rest did horribly\" - This actually is appropriate (depending on what you mean by \"horribly\". Normally the grades should follow a normal distribution, where most people get a 3.0, only a few get a 1.0 and only a few fail. \\r\\n\\r\\n2. \"All in all, the lectures were not in line or useful to the homework assignments or the tutorials either, and it's just a very poorly structured course\" - I actually thought the slides were alright. You can't really explain statistical methods (including the maths) with slides. For that you would need lecture notes or a book. So I think the slides were about as good as slides can be. If the slides have \"charts that compare different tests and distinctly highlight the similarities and differences/when to use which.\", I think they would encourage people to learn the material by heart and not really understand why they're doing what they're doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the course should focus more on explaining statistical concepts and the math behind it so people know what they're doing. 2 years ago, at least, it was relatively easy to get a decent grade without worrying about the math behind the concepts at all, which I think shouldn't be the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n",
