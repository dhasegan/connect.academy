Furthermore, the principal properties and applications of simple components (resistors, capacitors, inductances, diodes, Bipolar and FET transistors, Integrated circuits) will be covered. The theoretical concepts are deepened by ``hands on experience'' in the NatSciLab Electrical Engineering I, which is mandatory. The course is planned in such a manner that students should, as a rule, also take Electrical Engineering II in the Spring term. However, the course can also serve as a ``stand alone'' course within the shell model. The choice of what is taught (and to which depth) in General EE I and General EE II and their associated Lab Courses concentrates on those areas with high relevance for main stream and future EE developments.",

This course gives an introduction to electric and magnetic field theory, leading to Maxwell's equations. In addition, the theory is applied to wave propagation problems and guided waves on transmission lines. This knowledge enables us to understand the physics behind electrical signals travelling through lines and electronic devices. \nContents \nElectric Field: Electric charge, charge distributions, Coulomb's law, electric field, dipoles, electric flux, Gauss' law, potential, capacitance, \nCurrents: current density, conductance, superconductors, semiconductors, \n \nMagnetic Fields: magnetic force, magnetic flux, Ampere's law, inductance, Faraday's law, Lenz' law, displacement current, boundary conditions, \n \nElectromagnetic Waves: Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic waves, radiation \n \nGuided Waves: waves on transmission lines, wave reflection, standing waves, line parameters, Smith chart, cascaded two-port networks.",

The lab course is offered in conjunction with the course on Signals and Systems (300201). The concepts of signals and systems are generic and applications can be found in several areas like communications, speech and image processing, or process control. The goal of the lab is to apply these concepts by a combined approach of experiments and simulations. The experiments will provide the students with practical experience and allow the students to relate the experiments to signals and systems theory. \nTopics: \nStep response of RLC circuits, filters (RLC circuits), fourier transform and fourier series, sampling, digital filters, modulation, control experiment.",

The counter-intuitive behavior \ncomes from nonlinear interactions between the system components and the nonlinear processing \nof incoming information. This course is an introduction to nonlinear dynamics and control \nwith a focus on a broad range of applications. Topics include: \n1. Low dimensional autonomous dynamical systems: formulation as differential equation, \nflow, fixed points, stability, stability criteria, potentials and Lyapunov functionals, simple local \nbifurcations (saddle-node, pitchfork, transcritical, cusp, Hopf), simple numerical schemes, \ntime-discrete maps (fixed points, stability), introduction to chaos. \n2. Control for linear systems: general matrix-based solution for driven linear ODEs, reachability, \ncontrollability, observability, Gram-matrix for determining control laws and for reconstruction, \nlinear-state feedback controller, stable-state estimation, introduction to optimal control. \n3. Reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (activator-inhibitor, relations to control), \nstability of stationary solutions, Turing instability.",

This shows that this is an emerging field. It builds on radio engineering, digital communications, computer networks and protocols, distributed systems, information management, and applications. Most of these topics are taught in other specialization courses mainly within this major, but also within other majors. This course will equip students with the basic knowledge in wireless communications and radio system engineering. It will make the physical limitations of communications technologies understandable to the computer scientist, while making the system architecture and technology accessible to the electrical engineer.",

It is estimated that about 10\\% of all EE engineers work in microelectronics industry and their suppliers, and a much larger percentage depends directly or indirectly on a basic knowledge of microelectronics technology and production methods. It is therefore the objective of the course to provide an overview of the field. Topics to be covered are: production and quality of semiconductor materials; IC manufacturing technology; unit processes (photolithography, dry and wet etching, \nhot processes, layer deposition, assembly, testing) process integration, quality management, industrial engineering. In many of these topics, EE and CS competencies are applied. - A more thorough treatment of the subject on the key areas will be offered within the graduate program.",

The course provides an analytical framework for modeling and evaluating \npoint-to-point and multi-point communication. \nAfter a short rehearsal of probability and random variables and some excursion to random \nnumber generation, the key concept of information content of a signal source and information \ncapacity of a transmission medium are precisely defined, and their relationships to data compression \nalgorithms and error control codes are examined in detail. The course aims to install \nan appreciation for the fundamental capabilities and limitations of information transmission \nschemes and to provide the mathematical tools for applying these ideas to a broad class of \ncommunications systems. \nAside from source and channel aspects, an introduction to security is given, including publickey \ncryptography. \nInformation theory is standard in every communications-oriented Bachelor\u0092s program.",

        "Official Course Description": "As the feature size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink at a staggering rate, the increasing degree of integration allows very complex digital systems to be realized on a single chip. Such systems can either be fabricated in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) using very high scale integration (VLSI) techniques or implemented in programmable devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In both cases, very large designs are partitioned into a hierarchy of logical blocks, and by adhering to a set of standard design rules, the difficulty of integrating these blocks is dramatically reduced. The most popular approach is synchronous design with register transfer level (RTL) logic, but asynchronous designs are also possible. \n \nAlthough digital systems were traditionally designed at the schematic level, the current trend is towards hardware description languages (HDLs) that allow compact description of very complex hardware constructs. The appearance of sophisticated automatic hardware synthesis engines that implement logic directly from HDL have made HDLs the choice for new logic designs. Although the target language of this class is VHDL, other languages such as Verilog and SystemC apply the same design strategies. This course stresses the importance of viewing HDL as a way of describing real hardware, and not \"just another programming language\".",

Based on clear mathematical foundations (which are developed \nas needed) the course discusses abstract and concrete notions of computing machines, \ninformation, and algorithms, focusing on the question of representation vs. meaning in Computer \nScience. \nTo have a theoretical notion of computation, we introduce inductively defined structures, term \nrepresentations, abstract interpretation via equational substitution. This is contrasted with a \nfirst concrete model of computation: Standard ML, which will also act as the primary programming \nlanguage for the course. We cover a basic subset of ML that includes types, recursion, \ntermination, lists, strings, higher-order programming, effects, and exceptions. Back on the \ntheoretical side, we cover string codes, formal languages, Boolean expressions (syntax) and \nBoolean Algebras (semantics). The course introduces elementary complexity theory (big-O), \napplying it to analyzing the gate-complexity of Boolean Expressions (prime implicants and \nQuine McCluskey\u0092s algorithm).",

        "Official Course Description": "The course provides a foundation in the theory and applications of digital image processing. The first part will concentrate on morphological image processing, which is one of the most powerful tool sets in dealing with digital images and it is the backbone of many of today's high-performance image analysis systems. We will start on basic concepts of dilation, erosion, geodesic transformations, morphological filtering, and watershed transform, and will develop into advanced strategies for image segmentation and texture analysis. The second part of the course will concentrate on solving problems from biomedical, environmental, and industrial imaging, and will provide an overview of the broader field of image processing. As prerequisites either Signals and Systems Lab (300221) or Software Engineering Lab (320222) are accepted. The course can be combined with Digital Signal Processing (300302).",

        "Official Course Description": "Machine learning (ML) is all about algorithms which are fed with (large quantities of) real-world data, and which return a compressed ``model'' of the data. An example is the ``world model'' of a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its environment -- needed, for instance, for navigation. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings, from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech recognition systems. There is a large number of formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally large diversity of learning algorithms. However, there is a relatively small number of fundamental challenges which are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms: most notably, the ``curse of dimensionality'' and the almost deadly-dangerous problem of under- vs.\\ overfitting. This lecture introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, mixtures of Gaussians, Parzen windows). Furthermore, the course also provides an intense refresher of the requisite concepts from probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.",

        "Official Course Description": "Model-order reduction methods explore ways in which the complexity of the mathematical models of physical systems can be reduced for the purposes of expedient, yet accurate, computer-aided analysis. Recently, these methods are being pursued by the electromagnetics and circuits computer-aided design (CAD) communities in their efforts to develop efficient modeling tools capable of tackling the escalating complexity of the design and virtual prototyping of integrated mixed-signal systems. \nThis course offers a comprehensive view of the development and application of model-order reduction methods in the analysis and CAD of complex circuits and systems. \n \nIn particular, the first half of the course will be dedicated to the fundamentals of linear dynamical systems, their representation both in state space and input-output terms, and their approximation. \nThe methods developed will then be applied to model-order reduction for large linear circuits arising in modeling the interconnection networks in high-density integrated circuits. Applications include the reduction of both lumped RLC and transmission-line-based circuit models. \n \nThe course is based on the book: \"Approximation of large-scale systems\", by A.C. Antoulas, published by SIAM, Philadelphia, 2005.",

        "Official Course Description": "Typically, an antenna is the interface between the transceiver frontend and the free space. Antennas are used in many different applications, where mobile communication is only one, although, one of the most important ones. In many cases it is the antenna that causes some trouble (dysfunction, disconnection, etc.) if not properly designed and realized (maybe you remember the trouble with Apple's iPhone 4 antenna in 2010). Therefore, engineers who are working in the wireless business have to know about the working principles of antennas. \nThe course is organized as follows. After an introduction (chapter 1) we will recapitulate the Maxwell's Equations (chapter 2) and the basics of electromagnetic waves and their main characteristics. \nThese topics are foundational for understanding antenna theory. In chapter 4 the basic method for dealing with antenna problems is introduced which is the method of vector potentials calculated by a given antenna current that causes radiation in the transmit mode (or that is induced if the antenna is receiving). The Hertzian dipole and the electrically small loop antenna (i.e., a magnetic \ndipole) are calculated as the very first and very basic antennas. After that, the most important terms and definitions are introduced, i.e., radiation characteristic (beam pattern), directivity, gain, efficiency, path loss, half power beamwidth, and EIRP. In chapter 5 we calculate linear antennas, here, dipole antennas of different electrical lengths. Chapter 6 is devoted to array antennas and the calculation of the array factor. Exemplarily, different array configurations consisting of half-wavelength dipoles are considered. This deepens the understanding of how beamforming, nulling, etc. \ncan be realized by so called phased array antennas. \nIn chapter 7 aperture antennas are discussed. For that, the method of equivalent sources is introduced. This theory is then applied to horn antennas and slot antennas followed by parabolic reflector antennas and lens antennas. \nFinally, microstrip patch antennas and patch antenna arrays are investigated.",

        "Official Course Description": "Starting from basic knowledge in Digital Communications, this course will discuss Digital Subscriber Line transmission in quite some detail, still providing insights into counterpart wireless transmission schemes, such as WLAN and DVB-T. In order to obtain the basic foundation for digital communications, the course discusses matched filter, whitened matched filter, equalizer structures (linear, DFE, Tomlinson-Harashima) and equalizer adaptation with zero forcing and MMSE/LMS.We will apply these concepts to baseband and single-carrier transmission. Multicarrier transmission (OFDM/DMT) as the most current technology in wireline and wireless transmission will be treated thoroughly. \nThe wireline channel will be highlighted. Starting from channel properties of twisted pair and coaxial cables, all current wireline transmission methods will be studied in detail. Although the focus will be on twisted-pair transmission, cable modems (including hybrid fiber-coax) will be touched, as well. In xDSL and cable modems, we find almost every transmission method, like PAM, QAM, CAP, and multicarrier.",

        "Official Course Description": "Convex optimization is an important part of optimization in general. It deals with convex functions on convex domains. Convex problems are more general than linear ones but although convex optimization is about non-linear problems, optimum solutions are still globally optimal. The course is an introduction to the theory and application of convex optimization. It provides a wide variety of examples and discusses different optimization algorithms.",
